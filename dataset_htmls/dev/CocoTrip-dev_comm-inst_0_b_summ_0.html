<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area</span> or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here whilst attending a conference in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel</span>. Arriving from Toronto by train <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel</span>. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>well-located place to stay</span> in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful</span> and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor that has a plaque that says "Give Peace A Chance". The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was too small. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue. Beyond these comments it is a nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent a night at the Queen E with our grandchildren - it is a very nice place to stay - somewhat expensive but right in the center of Montreal. We upgraded to a suite which turned out to be very nice. The restuarant serves great breakfasts and dinners - again a bit expensive but very well done (the liver is great!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We visited the Biodome (lots of fun) and wondered around old Montreal area. Montreal has some great shopping areas we found</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have been to this hotel countless time as part of frequent business travel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is great for business</span> (right in financial centre) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and for leisure</span> (5 min walk to St Catherine Street where the shopping and restaurants are). I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had an encounter of very bad service once</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I took the matter to customer service aftewards and was impressed they listened and offered to upgrade my room</span> next time I stay. Overall it is a good hotel and I would recommand to others.</div><div class='text-box'>I recently stayed a w.end at this Hotel,and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I could not beleive</span> that at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the price they charge they put the coffee maker</span> and the coffee as part of the mini bar!come on,most hotel,leave the coffee maker and the coffee free of charge in the room!</div><div class='text-box'>Was able to upgrade to the Gold floor and worth every penny. Had dinner at the Beaver club and enjoyed the excellent service. It made our stay very memorable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is beautiful in the winter, a magical place</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I've stayed here a number of times and this visit was no exception. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I find the staff helpful</span> and enjoy the history of the hotel. As well <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I find the location very convenient</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were incredibly accommodating and the hotel was well located.</span></div></div>
