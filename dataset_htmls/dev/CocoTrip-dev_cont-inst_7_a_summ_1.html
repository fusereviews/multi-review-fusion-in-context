<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Like the other reviewers, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I have to say this hotel is close to perfect</span>. The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>modern rooms on the two</span> "executive" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>just off</span> Piazza Navona in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the historical center</span>, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best</span>. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!</div><div class='text-box'>Our second stay here in 12 months and the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return to Rome, just so I can stay here again! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is second to none</span> and we have been <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>able to walk to all the main sights from here</span>. We have stayed in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>three different rooms at this hotel</span> and they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>have all been fabulous</span>. The buffet breakfast is very good and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Richard Meier</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>rooms</span>, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>was very nice, with a spacious bathroom</span> and clever use of the available space. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain</span>, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>elevator needs a small facelift</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>but</span> nonetheless <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>it was fuctional</span> and the guest doesn't spend any time there. Breakfast was quite good, especially for Italy, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location just off piazza Navona, ideal</span>. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotel Raphael is absolutely gorgeous! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is very comfortable</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>quiet</span>. A reasonable journey from Campiano Airport should cost you no more than 40 euro. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our sheets were changed every day and the delicious chocolates on our bed every night were fantastic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The Bulgari toiletries smell gorgeous so enjoyed several long soaks in the bath</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Breakfast is amazing</span>, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful. Would highly recommend and would most definately visit again. - Mike and Alison</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A beautiful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>hotel in a very bustling area of Rome</span>. You expect everything to be perfect at an R&C but this is an entire staff taking service to whole new level. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Arrangements for</span> cars, tours and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>restaurants</span> via email.way before you get there. Thanks Anna. A glass of prosecco delivered anywhere in the hotel at the direction of Stephen in the restaurant. I can't say enough about this hotel</div><div class='text-box'>Selected hotel via Australian website. Very good value. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>could walk to all main places and sights in Rome</span>. Brekky was a good size buffet and on roof top garden at level 6. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms</span> not huge but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>good</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>nice bathroom</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Wifi</span> worked and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>was free</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Loved having pre-dinner wine on roof top while seeing the sun go down</span> on St Peter's basilica.</div><div class='text-box'>Highly recommend Hotel Raphael as it was perfect for my solo holiday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel Staff were excellent in making my stay comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is perfectly situated in Piazza Navona so</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>close to dining and shopping and of course historic sites</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were upgraded to a suite upon our arrival, and it only got better each day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The location is perfect</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>for accessing all the historic sights on foot</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and there were tons of fantastic restaurants right nearby</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is peaceful, spotless and comfortable enough.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's location is unbeatable and great if you like the hustle and bustle.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">You will be able to walk to main places in the city including great historical locations as well as some nice restaurants.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in this hotel are always really nice and have good bathrooms as well.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The sheets are always clean and there are delicious chocolates provided on the bed each night.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There was the option to have pre-dinner wine while watching the sunset, which was lovely.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There was free WiFi as well as gorgeous toiletries provided, which made for lovely soaks in the bathtub.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The decoration in the corridors needed a little bit of updating</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">but otherwise facilities were great.</span></div></div>
