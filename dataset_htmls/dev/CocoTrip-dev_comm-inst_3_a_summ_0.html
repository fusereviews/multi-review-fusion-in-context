<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I travel to Vancouver regularly on business and always stay at the Sutton Place Hotel. It is truly a top end hotel from the well appointed lobby, excellent restaurant, beautiful guest suites and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>no request is considered too small</span>. I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying "Welcome back to the Sutton Place". The beds are very comfortable, you get an excellent sleep. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient</span> for shopping and eating - lots of great locations around. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Service was spot-on from all the staff</span>. The hotel is a bit old but everything was still clean and renovated. Rooms were roomy and beds really comfortable. I only have 2 complaints - the parking is outrageous (40$ per night), and the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day). I think the hotel would be much better value if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Can definitely recommend this hotel</span> for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Room Service</span>, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>was excellent</span>. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service). The "gift shop" is really more of a convenience store than a gift shop, but there are plenty of other souvenir-type shops around. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Convenient walk to shops, restaurants and the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre</span>. Very, very comfortable bed. (No back pain, yay!)</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite. The rooms were lovely - plenty of room for three of us, beautiful views, very quiet. We had wi-fi and continental breakfast included in our rate - the wi-fi worked flawlessly and the morning pastries were delicious. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Service in this hotel is top rate</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>- the concierges helped us with car rental, spa and restaurant reservations</span>. And <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location couldn't be better</span>. We were able to walk everywhere downtown. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We highly recommend Sutton Place</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my third time staying at Sutton Place and love staying here. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location</span>, clean rooms, comfortable beds, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>friendly/helpful staff</span>. However, I don't recommend eating breakfast at the restaurant, pretty spendy for what you get. Maybe the buffet is the better way to go. Parking is spendy but hotel usually has a deal that helps cover the cost of parking. But this is my hotel of choice when I come to Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>First the service at Sutton Place was great and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is also great</span>. Unfortunately the hotel itself is outdated and the rooms are in need of an upgrade. The price was very reasonable, but it would be nice to see this hotel receive a much needed makeover.</div><div class='text-box'>We were pleased with the location of this Hotel as it is only a 10 minute downhill walk from Canada Place from where the Cruise Ships depart. Our room was clean and comfortable. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Hotel is very close to the main shopping area</span> and across the road we were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Trolley Tour.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>It is central to all downtown activities</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff are friendly,and helpful</span>. The restaurant is great with always a little chef's surprise. We also enjoy the pool which has good hours for use. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I have</span> stayed with friends and family and for business and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>never been disappointed.</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is highly recommended.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is in a great location and the staff at the hotel are very amiable and helpful to guests' needs.</span></div></div>
