<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner in August '09. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is located 50m around the corner from the famous Campo De 'Fiori</span> which is a wonderful area for eating and drinking as well as having great nightlife. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The room itself was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>beautifully done</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>in a period setting</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4 5'>Bed was large and aircon was fine</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>Staff extremely passionate and friendly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>about when and where to see the sights</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Location is excellent as only</span> a 5 minute walk to the piazza navona, 10 min walk to the trevi fountain and pantheon and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>15 min walk to Vaticano and Colosseum</span>. Also only a 10 min walk to the river and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife. There is a viewing deck above the top floor which is great to relax and have a few drinks and offers a really nice view of the area as well which was a bonus! No complaints whatsoever here, had a wonderful stay!</div><div class='text-box'>I can't say enough about the wonderful Hotel Campo De Fiori! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The location is perfect for sight seeing in Rome</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>typical European sized but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>beautiful and well-appointed</span>. I was a little concerned about <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>potential noise from the nearby square but with my windows shut I didn't hear a peep</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The photos on the web site are accurate and the roof-top deck is a dream</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The breakfast was ample with excellent coffee</span>. The best thing about the hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>the amazing staff</span> - Valentina, Matteo, Barbara, Gabriele, Angelo, Adam, Andrea & Andrew - not only <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>efficient and well-versed on the city,</span> they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>were kind hearted and lovely</span>. They <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>bent over backwards to make my stay truly special</span> and I can't wait to return!</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>visited Rome</span> for the first time this past November, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and we couldn't be happier with our stay</span> at Hotel Campo de Fiori. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location of the hotel is perfect, 5 minute walk to most of the sites</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>20 minute walk to the Vatican City and 20 minutes the other way to the Coliseum</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The hotel staff is extremely helpful and make good recommendations</span> on restaurants (La Scalla and The Library were two of our favorites, and will go back for sure to both). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were smaller - but they were loaded with character</span> and the bathrooms were superb.</div><div class='text-box'>After our port intensive Med cruise it was a relief to have such a haven as this hotel to unwind for three nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We loved our top floor room with it's own terrace and the access to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 9'>the fabulous large rooftop terrace</span> was right outside our door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The terrace was</span> not only <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>a great 360 degree view of the historic area of Rome</span> but it was such a great social place to join others over wine in the hours leading up to sunset. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Magic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The staff is so helpful and made us feel so welcome there</span>.
