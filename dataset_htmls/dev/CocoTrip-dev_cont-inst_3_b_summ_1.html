<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at L'Hermitage in Aug. 2008, just two months after it opened. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is a very sleek, modern hotel in a great location in downtown Vancouver</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Because it was so new, the staff seemed to still be figuring things out</span>. For example, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we weren't able to check into our room the first night for over an hour after the guaranteed check-in time.</span> To make up for this, the staff comped a round of drinks for us at their wonderful guest lounge on the 5th floor. The website did not do this place justice . there's a beautiful rooftop pool and hot tub and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms are large</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>luxuorious</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Very nice breakfast and afternoon h'or doeurve buffets are included in the price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff was very friendly and made sure that all of our needs were met</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be pampered in Vancouver</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>We will use this again. We stayed on 3 separate occasions in quick succession. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were always helpful, charming and friendly</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms elegant</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>spacious</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>wonderful bathrooms</span>) and the location was great, particularly if you are flying in (2 blocks down from Vancouver City Centre station on the Canada Line. Don't even think about a cab, on a Sunday when there is no $5 surcharge it cost under $6 for my wife and me to get to the airport. Heathrow and London Underground hang your heads in shame). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Treat yourself to the $17.50 breakfast buffet</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it must be the best "posh" value in Vancouver</span> !</div><div class='text-box'>We are a family of 5 and had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>an extremely comfortable</span> 4 night stay in their <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>2 bedroom suite</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Kudos to</span> Jean-michel & Hippo, Raymond, Elaisha, Mitch and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a super housekeeping team</span> for being so helpful and friendly. We felt most at home and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>strongly recommend to all who plan to visit Vancouver</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location with</span> Japadog and Viet-Sub eateries and Sears, Hudson Bay, Holt Renfrew nearby. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Easy access to the main attractions</span>. The team deserves a great pat on their backs for their great work attitude. Special thanks to Jean-michel for going out of your way for us.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a really great hotel</span> - near new, small boutique style, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>great rooms more like small apartments with full kitchens</span>. Fantastic pool and sun deck. Not a gripe, but you should know this hotel does not have room service - wasn't an issue for me, but may be for some travellers. great location - close to everything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Really reasonably priced compared to the other hotel i stayed in</span> during my stay in Vanvouver.</div><div class='text-box'>My stay at L'Hermitage <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>exceeded that of any other I have ever had in Vancouver</span>. I have stayed at many of the better hotels downtown while visiting this great city over the past 15 years. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were extraordinarily friendly and helpful</span> without being overbearing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>A great experience I will be recommending</span> to friends, family and business colleagues. Thank you L'Hermitage.</div><div class='text-box'>The front desk was fantastic. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Check in and check out were a breeze</span> as they let me spend more time with my family and getting to the wedding. It was the perfect end to our wedding night, the room was top notch! Thanks!</div><div class='text-box'>The amenities, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>breakfast buffet</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>service at this hotel are excellent</span>. Concierge helped us reserve a table at a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>great restaurant nearby (Goldfish)</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>we used the bikes to see Stanley Park</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>If and when I visit Canada again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel will be a definite</span>. It is great!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is the best in Vancouver.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel provides really good access to main attractions that are nearby.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel has lovely large rooms that felt very luxurious.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The housekeeping staff who were all excellent.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">It seemed like some wrinkles were still being ironed out because this is still a new hotel but check-in and check-out were smooth and easy.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">This hotel provides a really nice breakfast as well as an afternoon buffet that's included in the price, so it's definitely recommended to take advantage of this.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The pricing compared to other hotels makes this a really reasonable hotel.</span></div></div>
