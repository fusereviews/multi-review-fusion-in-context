<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner in August '09. The hotel is located 50m <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>around the corner from the famous Campo De 'Fiori</span> which is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>wonderful area for eating and drinking</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>as well as having great nightlife</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>The room itself was beautifully done</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>in a period setting</span>. Bed was large and aircon was fine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Staff extremely passionate and friendly about when and where to see the sights</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Location is excellent as only a 5 minute walk to the piazza navona</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>10 min walk to the trevi fountain and pantheon and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3'>15 min walk to Vaticano and Colosseum</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'> Also only a 10 min walk to the river</span> and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife. There is a viewing deck above the top floor which is great to relax and have a few drinks and offers a really nice view of the area as well which was a bonus! No complaints whatsoever here, had a wonderful stay!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I can't say enough about the wonderful Hotel Campo De Fiori</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is perfect for sight seeing in Rome</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>typical European sized</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beautiful and well-appointed</span>.
