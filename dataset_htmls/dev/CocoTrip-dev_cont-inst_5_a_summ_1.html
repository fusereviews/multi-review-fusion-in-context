<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>- First thing is the location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>no need for public transport</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>we could walk from hotel to anywhere</span>. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs</span>. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very clean, tidy and a safe hotel for reasonable price</span>. -I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it to friends.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time</span>. The room was immaculate, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bed amazingly comfortable</span> to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Great location too</span>. We paid for a cab <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>from Central St</span> on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>was only a 5 minute ride</span>. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definitely recommend this hotel</span> and will hopefully be going back in the near future!</div><div class='text-box'>the room was very small, but that's not the biggest problem - the receptionists were. the wifi at the lobby was very slow and the receptionists didnt even know how guests can log on (user name, password and patience required). but the worst was a french-speaking tall male <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>receptionist</span> who <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>was extremely rude</span> and made it very clear that he didnt like being asked about how to connect to the internet. he made condescending remarks in french about american tourists (and i'm not even american!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>the carpet is filthy</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>so is the hotel's surroundings</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>- noisy</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>crowded</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the street is disgusting after rain.</span></div><div class='text-box'>I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>its cleanliness and quietness</span>. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>didn't disappoint</span> on either count and had the added bonus of being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in an excellent location</span> - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent</span>, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again.</div><div class='text-box'>The Hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>perfectly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>placed for both travel and entertainment</span> on the edge of Rembrandt Square. It is within very easy walking distance to everywhere in Central Amsterdam, but sufficiently on the edge for it to be quiet at night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>It has a first class seafood Bistro</span> if you wish to eat in. It's main clientele are business and corporate, which should tell you a lot about the overall quality and respect this hotel has. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This has been my hotel of choice</span>, even when travelling privately to Amsterdam with family.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A good</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>hotel bang in the centre of Amsterdam</span>. Rooms are clean and modern and I will be staying there again. A couple of things to note: My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer), they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved. Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes.</div><div class='text-box'>We found our room the be of nice size and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>bothe the room and bath were easy to navigate in a wheelchair</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beds were compfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the room were nicely appointed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>staff was most helpful</span> with directions and other touristy information. The food in the restaurant's food was quite good with a nice selection. We would recommend the Eden Rembrandt Square as our stay was quite good.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location of the hotel is excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Its 5 mins from the Waterlooplein metro station and hence easily accessible</span>. Room service was mediocre - the staff came to clean the room once in 3 days in spite of a reminder. Hotel rooms were of good size.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a recommendable and respectable hotel for a great time whether you're travelling alone, with a partner, or with the family.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated in a perfect location and is very accessible via the metro station that is only five minutes away.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Adding to the great location is the fact that there are plenty of entertainment options very close-by.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the hotel were modern and well appointed.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Both the room and the bathroom were easily accessible for wheelchair users too.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Some of the staff was really rude.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There is a great seafood bistro at the hotel.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's carpets are absolutely filthy and the surroundings do not help with this vibe - it was crowded and noisy and after it rains the street is really disgusting.</span></div></div>
