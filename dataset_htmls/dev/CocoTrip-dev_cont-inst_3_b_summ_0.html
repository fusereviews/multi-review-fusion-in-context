<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at L'Hermitage in Aug. 2008, just two months after it opened. It is a very sleek, modern hotel in a great location in downtown Vancouver. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Because it was so new, the staff seemed to still be figuring things out</span>. For example, we weren't able to check into our room the first night for over an hour after the guaranteed check-in time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>To make up for this</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>the staff comped a round of drinks for us</span> at their wonderful guest lounge on the 5th floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The website did not do this place justice</span> . there's a beautiful rooftop pool and hot tub and the rooms are large and luxuorious. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Very nice breakfast and afternoon h'or doeurve buffets are included in the price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff</span> was very friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>made sure that all of our needs were met</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone</span> looking to be pampered in Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We will use this again</span>. We stayed on 3 separate occasions in quick succession. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff were always helpful</span>, charming and friendly, the rooms elegant and spacious (wonderful bathrooms) and the location was great, particularly if you are flying in (2 blocks down from Vancouver City Centre station on the Canada Line. Don't even think about a cab, on a Sunday when there is no $5 surcharge it cost under $6 for my wife and me to get to the airport. Heathrow and London Underground hang your heads in shame). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Treat yourself to the $17.50 breakfast buffet, it must be the best "posh" value in Vancouver</span> !</div><div class='text-box'>We are a family of 5 and had an extremely comfortable 4 night stay in their 2 bedroom suite. Kudos to Jean-michel & Hippo, Raymond, Elaisha, Mitch and a super housekeeping team for being so helpful and friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We felt most at home and strongly recommend to all who plan to visit Vancouver</span>. Great location with Japadog and Viet-Sub eateries and Sears, Hudson Bay, Holt Renfrew nearby. Easy access to the main attractions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The team deserves a great pat on their backs for their great work attitude</span>. Special thanks to Jean-michel for going out of your way for us.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>really great hotel</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>near new</span>, small boutique style, great rooms more like small apartments with full kitchens. Fantastic pool and sun deck. Not a gripe, but you should know this hotel does not have room service - wasn't an issue for me, but may be for some travellers. great location - close to everything! Really <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>reasonably priced compared to the other hotel</span> i stayed in during my stay in Vanvouver.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>My stay at L'Hermitage exceeded that of any other I have ever had in Vancouver</span>. I have stayed at many of the better hotels downtown while visiting this great city over the past 15 years. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff were extraordinarily friendly and helpful</span> without being overbearing. A great experience I will be recommending to friends, family and business colleagues. Thank you L'Hermitage.</div><div class='text-box'>The front <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>desk was fantastic</span>. Check in and check out were a breeze as they let me spend more time with my family and getting to the wedding. It was the perfect end to our wedding night, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was top notch</span>! Thanks!</div><div class='text-box'>The amenities, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>breakfast buffet</span> and service <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>at this hotel are excellent</span>. Concierge helped us reserve a table at a great restaurant nearby (Goldfish) and we used the bikes to see Stanley Park.</div><div class='text-box'>If and when I visit Canada again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel will be a definite</span>. It is great!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">You will want to come back again and again to this hotel because it exceeds any other hotels in the city.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff have a professional attitude, although due to it being a new venue some of the staff need a bit more time to develop.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">However, we were provided a complimentary round of drinks by staff due to this.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides a good breakfast and also an afternoon hor d'oeuvres buffet.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The staff also provided a complimentary round of drinks by way of an apology.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was a very good price and exceeded expectations set out by the website.</span></div></div>
