<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>My room was slightly smaller than average</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>although it was clean</span> and with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a slightly more modern decor</span> than a typical Fairmont. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>My one gripe is with the toilet</span>. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus</span>. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was fine</span>, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a fabulous view</span> up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains</span>, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor</span> that has a plaque that says "Give Peace A Chance". The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>bed was comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>bathroom was too small</span>. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet</span> or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue. Beyond these comments it is a nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent a night at the Queen E with our grandchildren - it is a very nice place to stay - somewhat expensive but right in the center of Montreal. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>upgraded to a suite which turned out to be very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The restuarant serves great breakfasts and dinners - again a bit expensive but very well done (the liver is great</span>!). We visited the Biodome (lots of fun) and wondered around old Montreal area. Montreal has some great shopping areas we found.</div><div class='text-box'>I have been to this hotel countless time as part of frequent business travel. The location is great for business (right in financial centre) and for leisure (5 min walk to St Catherine Street where the shopping and restaurants are). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I had an encounter of very bad service once</span>. I took the matter to customer service aftewards <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and was impressed they listened and offered to upgrade my room</span> next time I stay. Overall it is a good hotel and I would recommand to others.</div><div class='text-box'>I recently stayed a w.end at this Hotel,and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I could not beleive that</span> at the price they charge <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>they put the coffee maker and the coffee as part of the mini bar!come on</span>,most hotel,leave the coffee maker and the coffee free of charge in the room!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Was able to upgrade to the Gold floor and worth every penny</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Had dinner</span> at the Beaver club and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>enjoyed the excellent service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It made our stay very memorable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is beautiful in the winter</span>, a magical place.</div><div class='text-box'>I've stayed here a number of times and this visit was no exception. I find the staff helpful and enjoy the history of the hotel. As well I find the location very convenient.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is especially memorable during a winter stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The room was okay</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">but on the small side including the bathroom as well.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">After upgrading rooms to a suite this was absolutely fine and had a great view with modern decor.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Whilst the breakfast and dinners are both quite expensive they're really great and tasty.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">But a coffee maker and coffee was not free of charge, which is unusual.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Whilst the toiletries were really great there was an issue with the toilet.</span></div></div>
