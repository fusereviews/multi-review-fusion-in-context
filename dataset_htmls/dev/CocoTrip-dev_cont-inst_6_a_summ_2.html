<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Terrible disappointment Maybe a 1 or 2 star, but NOT 4! The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and thoughtful.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were a disappointment</span>. They are all run down (at least the 3 we saw)<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>, items are missing and not replaced, i.e. soap dishes, etc</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The carpeting is torn and worn</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>All the rooms we saw smell from odor</span>. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The elevator is not large enough</span> for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great little hotel</span>! We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was small but nice.</span> Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights.</div><div class='text-box'>Would recommend this hotel. We stayed at this hotel in October of 2005 for 7 days. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was small</span> but we knew that when we made our reservations. We found that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the stafff was extremely helpful</span> and gave us advice on the various activities that we should participate in and would help us to sign up for them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place</span> but it was perfect for what we needed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are small and there is no pool on site</span>. Being across the street from the beach we wouldn't have used the pool anyways. We thought that is was in the perfect location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>we were able to walk to everything</span>. I would recommend this hotel and would also stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Fab Location Literally across the road from Waikik beach, easy walk to all Waikik has to offer. Understand <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel</span> has recently been bought by Aqua chain and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>looks as if it will be undergoing renovation in the near future - scaffolding all around hotel during my stay with workmen there friom 9 - 5.</span> Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated - however, location compensates for this.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast is a bit of a joke</span> though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Even when there there is food left it's poor quality muffins only</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great Staff, superb location</span> - will be back ! First time visit to Hawaii - this hotel's location could not be beaten - just cross the road and you are on Waikiki beach and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the International Market Place is a few yards down the road</span>. Staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to help. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Rooms are spotlessly clean</span> - will definitely stay there again without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>Very oriental <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The rooms are not large, but decorated beautifullly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with antiques</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast in the atrium</span> with the Kona coffee <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was great</span>. Short walk across the stree to the beach. I would recommed it to anyone.</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent for the price This was taken from the beach, the brown building to the left of the blue signed building is the</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Small room</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>Great</span> view <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>View from the balcony</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a great hotel with nice touches but not a full resort some might look for.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It appeared to be having renovation work as there was scaffolding and workmen there.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Also, the AC barely worked and was noisy.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is within walking distance to everything such as the International Market Place.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Whilst clean and pretty nice the rooms aren't large at all and a little disappointing.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Breakfast is average, but it can be enjoyed next to the indoor atrium for guests to enjoy.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The carpet is in need of replacement and items in the room such as soap dishes were missing.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The elevators were too small as well.</span></div></div>
