<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms</span>, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>but that was nothing to complain about</span>. The staff was courteous, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the rooms were terrific</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the view was to die for</span>! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat</span> and would recommend it without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>There's no place like HHV! Just returned from our third visit to Hawaii and the Hilton Hawaiian Village (March 7-13). I cannot imagine staying anywhere other than HHV. It is like visiting an old and cherished friend. Our last two visits have been spent in the Ali Tower and the staff there is wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>You can quickly become spoiled to the twice a day maid service and the nightly turn-down service</span>. You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store! Just steps away from the beach, HHV is truly a part of paradise!</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent Stay Spent only 1 night in the Kahlia tower on the executive floor. I found the staff to be top notch, very friendly and professional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The room</span> in the Kahlia tower <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was</span> newly built and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very luxurious</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>with</span> a small patio and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>a great view out to sea</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The resort is very large</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>many shops and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6'>a great selection of restaurants</span>. We chose to leave the property and go next door for dinner to Kobe Steakhouse, well worth the walk. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Over all this is a great resort for</span> either a stop over before <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>your Hawaiian vacation</span> or even a week long visit. Expect resort prices for food and drink, but good quality.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Best Hotel on Waikiki Beach</span>! This is my second stay at this hotel. The service is wonderful and they have the nicest, cleanest and widest beach. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>They try their best to accommodate all guests' requests in spite of being one of the busiest hotels in the area</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6'>A wide choice of restaurants</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and shops</span>. If you have the $$, would definitely recommend it. There's no other hotel like the HHV on Waikiki Beach!</div><div class='text-box'>disappointing Was on the 31st floor of the Rainbow tower. Decor and furnishings are right from the 1970s. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Walls are paper-thin</span> - was kept awake by a crying baby next door. Hot water took about 20 mins to arrive. Extractor fan in the ceiling was full of hair. If I had been paying any more than the conference rate, I'd be upset! Very disappointing</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>loved it</span> We stayed only one night after staying on Maui and loved it. The hotel was expensive but we were on the waikiki side on a high floor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the view was incredible</span>. Worth it!</div><div class='text-box'>Loyal Hilton guest says.nice <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel</span> but average resort Beach and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>ocean view</span> from the 20th floor of Rainbow Tower</div><div class='text-box'>The how to save yourself from never leaving the HH Village Guide! Penguins at Hilton Hawaiian</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is very large and can accommodate thousands of guests but it still has that personal touch.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It has a lot of shops and a selection of restaurants to attend.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">A perfect venue for those on their way through Hawaii.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Whilst luxurious unfortunately the room has walls that are paper-thin.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">There is a nice view out to the sea however.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">You will feel spoiled by the twice-daily maid service provided.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There is a good selection of restaurants available at the hotel.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">It is worth noting that you need to get down to the pool early if you would like a lounger, but it is worth doing.</span></div></div>
