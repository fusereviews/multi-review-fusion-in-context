<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Like the other reviewers, I have to say <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel is close to perfect</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked</span> (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-modern rooms on the two "executive" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>just off Piazza Navona in the historical center</span>, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!</div><div class='text-box'>Our second stay here in 12 months and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return</span> to Rome, just so I can stay here again! The location is second to none and we have been able to walk to all the main sights from here. We have stayed in three different <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>rooms</span> at this hotel and they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>have all been fabulous</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The buffet breakfast is very good</span> and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Richard Meier rooms</span>, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was very nice, with a spacious bathroom</span> and clever use of the available space. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain</span>, and the elevator needs a small facelift, but nonetheless it was fuctional and the guest doesn't spend any time there. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast was quite good</span>, especially for Italy, and the location just off piazza Navona, ideal. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel Raphael is</span> absolutely gorgeous! It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>very comfortable</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>clean and quiet</span>. A reasonable journey from Campiano Airport should cost you no more than 40 euro. Our sheets were changed every day and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the delicious chocolates on our bed every night were fantastic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The Bulgari toiletries smell gorgeous</span> so enjoyed several long soaks in the bath. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast is amazing</span>, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful. Would highly recommend and would most definately visit again. - Mike and Alison</div><div class='text-box'>A beautiful hotel in a very bustling area of Rome. You expect everything to be perfect at an R&C but this is an entire staff taking service to whole new level. Arrangements for cars, tours and restaurants via email.way before you get there. Thanks Anna. A glass of prosecco delivered anywhere in the hotel at the direction of Stephen in the restaurant. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I can't say enough about this hotel</span></div><div class='text-box'>Selected hotel via Australian website. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very good value</span>. Great location - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>could walk to all main places and sights in Rome</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Brekky was a good size buffet</span> and on roof top garden at level 6. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rooms not huge but good and nice bathroom</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Wifi worked and was free</span>. Loved having pre-dinner wine on roof top while seeing the sun go down on St Peter's basilica.</div><div class='text-box'>Highly recommend Hotel Raphael as it was perfect for my solo holiday. Hotel Staff were excellent in making my stay comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The hotel is perfectly situated</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in Piazza Navona so</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>close to dining and shopping and of course historic sites</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were upgraded to a suite upon our arrival, and it only got better each day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is perfect for accessing all the historic sights on foot</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>there were tons of fantastic restaurants right nearby</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is tranquil and clean and overall an enjoyable place to stay whilst in Rome.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is close to a number of local restaurants and the busier areas of Rome.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the hotel are adequate with spacious bathrooms.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff leave a chocolate on the beds each night for their guests.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The buffet breakfast was very good.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's corridors were quite plain and could benefit from some decoration.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The free Wi-Fi worked well and the Bulgari toiletries smelled lovely.</span></div></div>
