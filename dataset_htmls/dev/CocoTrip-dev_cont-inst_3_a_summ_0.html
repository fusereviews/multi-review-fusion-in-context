<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I travel to Vancouver regularly on business and always stay at the Sutton Place Hotel. It is truly a top end <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel</span> from the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>well appointed lobby</span>, excellent restaurant, beautiful guest suites and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile and no request is considered too small. I stay in La Grande Residence where <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks</span>, relaxed and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>stress-free</span>. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying "Welcome back to the Sutton Place". <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The beds are very comfortable</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>you get an excellent sleep</span>. The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver but the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner!</div><div class='text-box'>Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient for shopping and eating</span> - lots of great locations around. Service was spot-on from all the staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 5'>The hotel is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>a bit old</span> but everything <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was</span> still <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>renovated</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms were roomy</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beds really comfortable</span>. I only have 2 complaints - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>the parking is outrageous (40$ per night)</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> and the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day)</span>. I think <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel would be much better value if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges</span>! Can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used Room Service, which was excellent. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service). The "gift shop" is really more of a convenience store than a gift shop, but there are plenty of other souvenir-type shops around. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Convenient walk to shops</span>, restaurants <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Very, very comfortable bed</span>. (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>No back pain, yay</span>!)</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms</span> were lovely - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>plenty of room for three of us</span>, beautiful views, very quiet. We had wi-fi and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>continental breakfast included in our rate</span> - the wi-fi worked flawlessly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the morning pastries were delicious</span>. Service in this hotel is top rate - the concierges helped us with car rental, spa and restaurant reservations. And <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the location couldn't be better</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We were able to walk everywhere downtown</span>. We highly recommend Sutton Place.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my third time staying at Sutton Place and love staying here. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>clean rooms</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>comfortable beds</span>, friendly/helpful staff. However, I don't recommend eating <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>breakfast at the restaurant,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>pretty spendy for what you get</span>. Maybe the buffet is the better way to go. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Parking is spendy but hotel usually has a deal that helps cover the cost of parking</span>. But this is my hotel of choice when I come to Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>First the service at Sutton Place was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location is also great</span>. Unfortunately <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>hotel itself is outdated and the rooms are in need of an upgrade</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The price was very reasonable</span>, but it would be nice to see this hotel receive a much needed makeover.</div><div class='text-box'>We were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>pleased with the location of this Hotel as it is only a 10 minute downhill walk from Canada Place from where the Cruise Ships depart</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Our room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>comfortable</span>. The Hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very close to the main shopping area and across the road we were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Trolley Tour</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is central to all downtown activities</span> and the staff are friendly,and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The restaurant is great with always a little chef's surprise</span>. We also enjoy <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the pool which has good hours for use</span>. I have stayed with friends and family and for business and never been disappointed.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was clean and reasonably priced.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel does need a makeover and would improve if some of the charges were lowered.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is located in a really great area with a really handy walk to the shopping area and restaurants, as well as a convention centre nearby.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are spacious and flawlessly clean with everything available that you could possibly need.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The bed was unbelievably comfortable and provide a great night's sleep.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a little bit outdated and in need of a bit of an upgrade though.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had an expensive breakfast however overall the food is great.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The pool at the hotel is open for a good amount of time for guests.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There is also parking available which is a bit expensive, but the hotel can help out with it.</span></div></div>
