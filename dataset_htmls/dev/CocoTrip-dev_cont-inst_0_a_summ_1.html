<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Our company has rented conference rooms and held many meetings and corporate events at Place D'Armes and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>we were extremely satisfied</span> with their service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>There was always someone to greet and help</span> with the setup and make sure we have everything we needed. More importantly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>technical service was efficient and really went out of their way</span> (even when it is your own equipment). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are clean and beautiful</span> and staff is great. The only negative thing is that they charge for the conference room for the whole day regardless if you only need it for half a day or an hour.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is located in the OLD Town part of Montreal by the Notre Dame Cathedral and short walking distance to the rivers edge. This hotel was a great value and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>staff and location were excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There are 2 restaurants in the hotel that are very highly rated</span>. The staff and service were excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>The rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>are specious</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>nicely decorated</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The bathrooms are very nice with very big bathtubs</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There is also a roof terrace to have drinks</span> and enjoy the views. Couldn't use because it was raining.</div><div class='text-box'>We just returned from a mid-winter weekend get away to Montreal. We picked this hotel due to its <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>location</span> in Old Montreal, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>close to restaurants</span>, Notre Dame and the cobblestone streets. From the moment we arrived when the valet service looked after the car until we checked out the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>service of the staff was top notch</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>rooms were nice</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with hardwood floors and exposed brick</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The bar, Suite701, is the perfect spot for a night cap</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We would definately return</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Absolutely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>one of the best places to stay</span> while visiting old city Montreal. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The rooftop bar and restaurant was beautiful</span> with a view of Notre Dame Basilica. We stayed in Junior Suite 3402 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>really appreciated the ambiance and decor</span>. If I were to visit again I would think of staying in 3602 (second digit is the floor). The street noise was not bad however you will have early morning local truck deliveries.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Lovely hotel</span> in an historic building with a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fantastic location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Nice rooms</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very friendly and service-oriented staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Great little touches</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>like</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>chocolates on the pillow</span> and turn-down service. Very helpful concierge. I was in Laval for business and went to Montreal for the weekend. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I walked to restaurants, bars</span>, the river, shopping. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Close enough to walk to Mont Royal</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed in one of the Suites which we got using one of the major credit card upgrades. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Amazing bathroom with rain shower and a large tub.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Modern room</span>, clean bathroom, great service, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>great beds and blankets</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>only thing that it lacks it is a pool</span> but it can be overlooked. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Location is great</span>, the old Montreal.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Le Place D'Armes is an amazingly elegant hotel</span> with staff that have a beautiful authenticity about them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The comfort and design of the rooms</span> is worth the price and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>is a great fit for both business or personal occasions</span>. If you are planning a trip to Montreal you simply need to check out this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>Well I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it was just wonderful in every way</span>. Perfect location, spotless, nice staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Possibly the nicest place</span> I have ever stayed.
