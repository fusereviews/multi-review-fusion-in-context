<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I travel to Vancouver regularly on business and always stay at the Sutton Place Hotel. It is truly a top end hotel from the well appointed lobby, excellent restaurant, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beautiful guest suites</span> and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile and no request is considered too small. I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying "Welcome back to the Sutton Place". The beds are very comfortable, you get an excellent sleep. The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver but the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner!</div><div class='text-box'>Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient for shopping and eating - lots of great locations around. Service was spot-on from all the staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is a bit old</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>everything was still clean</span> and renovated. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Rooms were roomy</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beds really comfortable</span>. I only have 2 complaints - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>the parking is outrageous (40$ per night)</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day)</span>. I think <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel would be much better</span> value <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges</span>! Can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used Room Service, which was excellent. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service). The "gift shop" is really more of a convenience store than a gift shop, but there are plenty of other souvenir-type shops around. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Convenient walk to</span> shops, restaurants and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre</span>. Very, very comfortable bed. (No back pain, yay!)</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were lovely - plenty of room for three of us, beautiful views</span>, very quiet. We had wi-fi and continental breakfast included in our rate - the wi-fi worked flawlessly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the morning pastries were delicious</span>. Service in this hotel is top rate - the concierges helped us with car rental, spa and restaurant reservations. And the location couldn't be better. We were able to walk everywhere downtown. We highly recommend Sutton Place.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my third time staying at Sutton Place and love staying here. Great location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean rooms</span>, comfortable beds, friendly/helpful staff. However, I don't recommend eating breakfast at the restaurant, pretty spendy for what you get. Maybe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the buffet is the better way to go</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Parking is spendy but hotel usually has a deal that helps cover the cost of parking</span>. But this is my hotel of choice when I come to Vancouver!</div><div class='text-box'>First the service at Sutton Place was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is also great. Unfortunately the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel itself is outdated</span> and the rooms are in need of an upgrade. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The price was very reasonable</span>, but it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>would be nice to see this hotel receive a much needed makeover</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were pleased with the location of this Hotel as it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>only a 10 minute downhill walk from Canada Place</span> from <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>where the Cruise Ships depart</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>Our room was clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and comfortable</span>. The Hotel is very close to the main shopping area and across the road we were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Trolley Tour.</div><div class='text-box'>It is central to all downtown activities and the staff are friendly,and helpful. The restaurant is great with always a little chef's surprise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We also enjoy the pool which has good hours for use</span>. I have stayed with friends and family and for business and never been disappointed.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The price of this hotel is okay</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">but it feels somewhat dated and needs an overall makeover.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">That said, the place is clean.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated close to the Vancouver Convention Centre and 10 minutes from Canada Place where you can catch a cruise ship.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel were very nice and spacious, with stunning views of the surrounding area.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The morning pastries and buffet was pretty good here at the hotel.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There was a great pool to use for hours, which is great.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There is a deal to help out with the somewhat pricey parking, too, if you're thinking of using a car here.</span></div></div>
