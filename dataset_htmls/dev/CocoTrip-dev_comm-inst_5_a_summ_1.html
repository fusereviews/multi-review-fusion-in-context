<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>- First thing is the location, no need for public transport, we could walk from hotel to anywhere. - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause</span> in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>there are cheaper places to eat</span>. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - Very clean, tidy and a safe hotel for reasonable price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>-I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it</span> to friends.</div><div class='text-box'>Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was immaculate</span>, and the bed amazingly comfortable to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two. Great location too. We paid for a cab <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>from Central St</span> on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>was only a 5 minute ride</span>. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definitely recommend this hotel</span> and will hopefully be going back in the near future!</div><div class='text-box'>the room was very small, but that's not the biggest problem - the receptionists were. the wifi at the lobby was very slow and the receptionists didnt even know how guests can log on (user name, password and patience required). but the worst was a french-speaking tall male receptionist who was extremely rude and made it very clear that he didnt like being asked about how to connect to the internet. he made condescending remarks in french about american tourists (and i'm not even american!). the carpet is filthy and so is the hotel's surroundings - noisy, crowded, and the street is disgusting after rain.</div><div class='text-box'>I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>its cleanliness and quietness</span>. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>didn't disappoint</span> on either count and had the added bonus of being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>in an excellent location</span> - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The modern room was</span> nice and the bathroom was excellent, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The Hotel is perfectly placed</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for both travel and entertainment</span> on the edge of Rembrandt Square. It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>within very easy walking distance to everywhere in Central Amsterdam</span>, but sufficiently on the edge for it to be quiet at night. It has a first class seafood Bistro if you wish to eat in. It's main clientele are business and corporate, which should tell you a lot about the overall quality and respect this hotel has. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This has been my hotel of choice</span>, even when travelling privately to Amsterdam with family.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>A good hotel bang in the centre of Amsterdam</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Rooms are clean and modern</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I will be staying there again</span>. A couple of things to note: My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer), they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We found our room the be of nice size and bothe the room and bath were easy to navigate in a wheelchair. The beds were compfortable and the room were nicely appointed. The staff was most helpful with directions and other touristy information. The food in the restaurant's food was quite good with a nice selection. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would recommend the Eden Rembrandt Square as our stay was quite good</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location of the hotel is excellent</span>. Its 5 mins from the Waterlooplein metro station and hence easily accessible. Room service was mediocre - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff came to clean the room once in 3 days</span> in spite of a reminder. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel rooms were of good size</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a highly recommended hotel with clean modern rooms.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Additionally the hotel is peacefully located but close enough to walk to the centre of the city.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast provided in the hotel was quite good too.</span></div></div>
