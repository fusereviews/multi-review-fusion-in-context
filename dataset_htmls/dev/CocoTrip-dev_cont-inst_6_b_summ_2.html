<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The hotel was completely booked (President's Week)</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>but you would never know</span> it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool</span>, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for</span>! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>go on day journeys</span> but also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>enjoyed the days sitting</span> by the pool or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>on the beach</span> (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat and would recommend it without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>There's no place like HHV! Just returned from our third visit to Hawaii and the Hilton Hawaiian Village (March 7-13). I cannot imagine staying anywhere other than HHV. It is like visiting an old and cherished friend. Our last two visits have been spent in the Ali Tower and the staff there is wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>You can quickly become spoiled to the twice a day maid service and the nightly turn-down service</span>. You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Just steps away from the beach</span>, HHV is truly a part of paradise!</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent Stay Spent only 1 night in the Kahlia tower on the executive floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I found the staff to be top notch, very friendly and professional</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room</span> in the Kahlia tower <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was</span> newly built and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very luxurious</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with a small patio and a great view out to sea</span>. The resort is very large with many shops and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>a great selection of restaurants</span>. We chose to leave the property and go next door for dinner to Kobe Steakhouse, well worth the walk. Over all this is a great resort for either a stop over before your Hawaiian vacation or even a week long visit. Expect resort prices for food and drink, but good quality.</div><div class='text-box'>Best Hotel on Waikiki Beach! This is my second stay at this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The service is wonderful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>they have the nicest</span>, cleanest and widest <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>beach</span>. They try their best to accommodate all guests' requests in spite of being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>one of the busiest hotels</span> in the area! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>A wide choice of restaurants</span> and shops. If you have the $$, would definitely recommend it. There's no other hotel like the HHV on Waikiki Beach!</div><div class='text-box'>disappointing Was on the 31st floor of the Rainbow tower. Decor and furnishings are right from the 1970s. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Walls are paper-thin - was kept awake by a crying baby next door</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Hot water took about 20 mins</span> to arrive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Extractor fan in the ceiling was full of hair</span>. If I had been paying any more than the conference rate, I'd be upset! Very disappointing</div><div class='text-box'>loved it We stayed only one night after staying on Maui and loved it. The hotel was expensive but we were on the waikiki side on a high floor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the view was incredible</span>. Worth it!</div><div class='text-box'>Loyal Hilton guest says.nice hotel but average resort <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>Beach and ocean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>view from the 20th floor</span> of Rainbow Tower</div><div class='text-box'>The how to save yourself from never leaving the HH Village Guide! Penguins at Hilton Hawaiian</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is one of the busiest hotels on Waikiki beach.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">During a fully booked 'President's Week' it was busy but did not seem over crowded.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very luxurious that include stunning views from the small patio.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">However, the walls are thin so it does get quite noisy.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The service provided is exceptional day and night.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel offers a choice of restaurants.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Get down to the pool early to get a lounger for a day at the pool or get away on a day journey or spend a day at the beach.</span></div></div>
