<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>- First thing is the location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>no need for public transport</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>we could walk from hotel to anywhere</span>. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>20-50 meters on the Rembrandt</span> square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs</span>. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>Very clean, tidy</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and a safe</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 8'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for reasonable price</span>. -I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it to friends.</div><div class='text-box'>Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>The room was immaculate</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bed amazingly comfortable</span> to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location</span> too. We paid for a cab <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>from Central St</span> on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was only a 5 minute ride</span>. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully be going back in the near future!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>the room was very small</span>, but that's not the biggest problem - the receptionists were. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the wifi at the lobby was very slow and the receptionists didnt even know how guests can log on</span> (user name, password and patience required). but the worst was a french-speaking tall <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>male receptionist</span> who <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was extremely rude and made it very clear that he didnt like being asked about how to connect to the internet</span>. he made condescending remarks in french about american tourists (and i'm not even american!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>the carpet is filthy and so is the hotel's surroundings</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>-</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>noisy</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>crowded</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> and the street is disgusting after rain</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being its <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>cleanliness</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and quietness</span>. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>didn't disappoint</span> on either count and had the added bonus of being in an excellent location - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent</span>, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Hotel is perfectly placed for both travel and entertainment on the edge of Rembrandt Square</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>It is within very easy walking distance to everywhere in Central Amsterdam</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but sufficiently on the edge for it to be</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>quiet at night</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>It has a first class seafood Bistro</span> if you wish to eat in. It's main clientele are business and corporate, which should tell you a lot about the overall quality and respect this hotel has. This has been my hotel of choice, even when travelling privately to Amsterdam with family.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A good hotel bang in the centre of Amsterdam</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>Rooms are clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and modern</span> and I will be staying there again. A couple of things to note: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer),</span> they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved. Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes.</div><div class='text-box'>We found our room the be of nice size and bothe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the room and bath were easy to navigate in a wheelchair</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The beds were compfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the room were nicely appointed</span>. The staff was most helpful with directions and other touristy information. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The food in the restaurant's food was quite good with a nice selection</span>. We would recommend the Eden Rembrandt Square as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>our stay was quite good</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The location of the hotel is excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Its 5 mins from the Waterlooplein metro station</span> and hence easily accessible. Room service was mediocre - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the staff came to clean the room once in 3 days in spite of a reminder.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Hotel rooms were of good size</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A great hotel to stay at, it is central to the city centre of Amsterdam, yet still at a very reasonable price.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">With the hotel being only five minutes from the metro station access to travel and entertainment near Rembrandt Square or you can simply walk to most places.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very nice with great bathrooms.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">and the beds are so comfortable.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Some rooms are on the small side and some are wheelchair friendly.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Particularly rude member of staff on the reception desk that is very unhelpful.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">This hotel has a great seafood bistro restauraunt.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Although there is Wi-Fi available at this hotel, it can be very slow and the staff aren't the most efficient at helping guests log in.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is also quite dirty, particularly the carpets, and it can get very noisy and crowded in places.</span></div></div>
