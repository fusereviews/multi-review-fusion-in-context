<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Our company has <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rented conference rooms</span> and held many meetings <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and corporate events</span> at Place D'Armes and we were extremely satisfied with their service. There was always someone to greet and help with the setup and make sure we have everything we needed. More importantly, technical service was efficient and really went out of their way (even when it is your own equipment). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are</span> clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beautiful</span> and staff is great. The only negative thing is that they charge for the conference room for the whole day regardless if you only need it for half a day or an hour.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is located</span> in the OLD Town part of Montreal by the Notre Dame Cathedral and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>short walking distance to the rivers edge</span>. This hotel was a great value and the staff and location were excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There are 2 restaurants in the hotel</span> that are very highly rated. The staff and service were excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are specious and nicely decorated</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bathrooms are very nice with very big bathtubs</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There is also a roof terrace to have drinks</span> and enjoy the views. Couldn't use because it was raining.</div><div class='text-box'>We just returned from a mid-winter weekend get away to Montreal. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We picked this hotel due to its location</span> in Old Montreal, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>close to restaurants</span>, Notre Dame and the cobblestone streets. From the moment we arrived when the valet service looked after the car until we checked out the service of the staff was top notch. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were nice with hardwood floors and exposed brick</span>. The bar, Suite701, is the perfect spot for a night cap. We would definately return.</div><div class='text-box'>Absolutely one of the best places to stay while visiting old city Montreal. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The rooftop bar</span> and restaurant <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was beautiful</span> with a view of Notre Dame Basilica. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>stayed in Junior Suite 3402 and really appreciated the</span> ambiance and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>decor</span>. If I were to visit again I would think of staying in 3602 (second digit is the floor). The street noise was not bad however you will have early morning local truck deliveries.</div><div class='text-box'>Lovely hotel in an historic building with a fantastic location. Nice rooms, very friendly and service-oriented staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Great little touches like chocolates on the pillow</span> and turn-down service. Very helpful concierge. I was in Laval for business and went to Montreal for the weekend. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>walked to restaurants</span>, bars, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the river</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>shopping</span>. Close enough to walk to Mont Royal.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed in one of the Suites which we got using one of the major credit card upgrades. Amazing bathroom with rain shower and a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>large tub</span>. Modern room, clean bathroom, great service, great beds and blankets. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The only thing that it lacks it is a pool</span> but it can be overlooked. Location is great, the old Montreal.</div><div class='text-box'>Le Place D'Armes is an amazingly elegant hotel with staff that have a beautiful authenticity about them. The comfort and design of the rooms is worth the price and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is a great fit for both business or personal occasions</span>. If you are planning a trip to Montreal you simply need to check out this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>Well I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, it was just wonderful in every way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Perfect location</span>, spotless, nice staff. Possibly the nicest place I have ever stayed. If you go to montreal and dont stay here you're missing out!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has conference rooms available to rent out for conferences and corporate events.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel makes it easy to access restaurants, the river and shops.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are a good size and well decorated.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The bathroom in the hotel was large and with a large bathtub.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Small touches like a chocolate on the pillow are also nice.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has a roof terrace for drinks.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Unfortunately the hotel is missing the availability of a pool.</span></div></div>
