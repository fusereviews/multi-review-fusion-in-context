<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Terrible disappointment Maybe a 1 or 2 star, but NOT 4! The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and thoughtful.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5 7'>The rooms were</span> a disappointment. They are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5 7'>all run down</span> (at least the 3 we saw), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>items are missing and not replaced</span>, i.e. soap dishes, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>The carpeting is torn and worn</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>All the rooms we saw smell from odor</span>. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> which is still 2 star in my opinion</span>. The elevator is not large enough for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby.</div><div class='text-box'>Great little hotel! We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small but nice</span>. Upon hearing that we just got married, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room</span> and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights.</div><div class='text-box'>Would recommend this hotel. We stayed at this hotel in October of 2005 for 7 days. The hotel was small but we knew that when we made our reservations. We found that the stafff was extremely helpful and gave us advice on the various activities that we should participate in and would help us to sign up for them. If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place but it was perfect for what we needed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are small</span> and there is no pool on site. Being across the street from the beach we wouldn't have used the pool anyways. We thought that is was in the perfect location, we were able to walk to everything. I would recommend this hotel and would also stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Fab Location Literally across the road from Waikik beach, easy walk to all Waikik has to offer. Understand <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel</span> has recently been bought by Aqua chain and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>looks as if it will be undergoing renovation in the near future - scaffolding all around</span> hotel during my stay with workmen there friom 9 - 5. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated</span> - however, location compensates for this.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast is a bit of a joke</span> though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Even when there there is food left it's poor quality muffins only</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great Staff, superb location - will be back ! First time visit to Hawaii - this hotel's location could not be beaten - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>just cross the road and you are on Waikiki beach and the International Market Place is a few yards down the road</span>. Staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to help. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>Rooms are spotlessly clean</span> - will definitely stay there again without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>Very oriental <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>The rooms are not large, but decorated beautifullly</span> with antiques. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast in the atrium</span> with the Kona coffee <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>was great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Short walk across the stree to the beach</span>. I would recommed it to anyone.</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent for the price This was taken from the beach, the brown building to the left of the blue signed building is the</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Small room</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Great view</span> View <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>from the balcony</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is currently undergoing renovations so the outside is an eyesore.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Air conditioners are outdated and not well maintained too.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There are great sights to visit nearby.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Some of the rooms were small but nice, others smelled a bit</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">so an upgrade may be necessary to get a nicer experience.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The nicer rooms were very clean and decorated beautifully.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast in the atrium is superb when there is enough food for everyone.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The rooms could do with some upgrading as some of the carpet has been worn down.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Items are sometimes missing from the rooms and the elevator is not big enough for a surfboard.</span></div></div>
