<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We had an absolutely great time</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The hotel was completely booked</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>(President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>but you would never know it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about</span>. The staff was courteous, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for</span>! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat</span> and would recommend it without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>There's no place like HHV! Just returned from our third visit to Hawaii and the Hilton Hawaiian Village (March 7-13). I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cannot imagine staying anywhere other than HHV</span>. It is like visiting an old and cherished friend. Our last two visits have been spent in the Ali Tower and the staff there is wonderful. You can quickly become spoiled to the twice a day maid service and the nightly turn-down service. You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store! Just steps away from the beach, HHV is truly a part of paradise!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Excellent Stay</span> Spent only 1 night in the Kahlia tower on the executive floor. I found the staff to be top notch, very friendly and professional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room in the Kahlia tower was</span> newly built and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very luxurious</span>, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>a small patio and a great view out to sea</span>. The resort is very large with many shops and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>a great selection of restaurants</span>. We chose to leave the property and go next door for dinner to Kobe Steakhouse, well worth the walk. Over all this is a great resort for either a stop over before your Hawaiian vacation or even a week long visit. Expect resort prices for food and drink, but good quality.</div><div class='text-box'>Best Hotel on Waikiki Beach! This is my second stay at this hotel. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>service is wonderful and they have the nicest</span>, cleanest and widest <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beach</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>They try their best to accommodate all guests' requests</span> in spite of being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>one of the busiest hotels in the area</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>A wide choice of restaurants</span> and shops. If you have the $$, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would definitely recommend it</span>. There's no other hotel like the HHV on Waikiki Beach!</div><div class='text-box'>disappointing Was on the 31st floor of the Rainbow tower. Decor and furnishings are right from the 1970s. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Walls are paper-thin</span> - was kept awake by a crying baby next door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hot water took about 20 mins</span> to arrive. Extractor fan in the ceiling was full of hair. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If I had been paying any more than the conference rate, I'd be upset</span>! Very disappointing</div><div class='text-box'>loved it We stayed only one night after staying on Maui and loved it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was expensive but</span> we were on the waikiki side on a high floor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the view was incredible. Worth it!</span></div><div class='text-box'>Loyal Hilton guest says.nice hotel but average resort Beach and ocean view from the 20th floor of Rainbow Tower</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The how to save yourself from never leaving the HH Village Guide</span>! Penguins at Hilton Hawaiian</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A great stay at this hotel and will keep coming back.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It can get really busy here</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">but you wouldn't know it.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the hotel were luxurious but the walls were very thin.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has good access to lots of local restaurants with a wide variety of choice available.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There were some great aspect to this hotel such as the super-pool, although it is recommended you head down for a lounger quite early but this isn't a big deal.</span></div></div>
