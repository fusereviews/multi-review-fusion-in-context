<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The first moment you get there you want to go to another hotel</span>. A very ugly industrial <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location on the train station</span>. The lobi is small and depressing. The hotel has a stupid childish moto of a space ship which could have been OK if it was located in Dysney World.the pros are that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the rooms are</span> modern and comfortable although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>small</span>. A big problem is the tualet that is located centraly and cant be closed properly so you have to share the smells and small noises of your activities there.important tip: when you take the subway that is located under the hotel, start always with the Blue L5 line and not the green L3, and change the lines at Diagonal station. It will save you a lot of walking.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 4 days at Barcelo Sants in April. It was the first time, that we have been in Barcelona and the city is really wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is well located</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>you can reach the metro within 5 minutes</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>therefore it is easy to reach all sight seeing hot spots</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was clean</span>, but you can see, that the hotel is already a few years old. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The front desk staff was very helpful</span> with restaurant recommandations and directions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We booked via expedia.com and got a very reasonable rate</span>. The only thing we really disliked, is that there is no way to open the windows in the room, and the aircondition was not working very well.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for only one night, and most of my comments are similar to others' critiques. Very easy access from the airport - frequent trains take you to Barcelona Sants station and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel is right on top of the station</span> (elevator in the station takes you right to the lobby). A metro station is here as well, making it convenient to get to wherever you're going on Barcelona's excellent subway lines. Other than that, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel is pretty drab</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>rooms are small</span>, beds are hard, and the walls are paper-thin (noisy throughout the night). And, as expected for a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>train station area</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the neighbourhood seems fairly seedy.</span></div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Barcelo Sants for 4 nights in March 2005 and found the hotel to live up to our expectations. The location is great as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it is located right above the train, bus and metro stations</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Service to</span> the airport, the rest of Spain (and even France) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>elsewhere</span> in the city <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>are fast and practical</span>. The hotel has its own entrance directly in the station. Also, for those who do not want to eat at the hotel restaurant, the station has several restaurants which are not expensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The room was big enough</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'> clean</span>, and the service impeccable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>We would return</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was</span> better than I expected for being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>on top of the train station</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>It's a great location</span> if you want to be close to the train. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>If you want to hang out on Las Ramblas, better to stay there</span>. Metro stops running at midnight during the week and you'll need to catch a cab back to Sants. You will definitely not be done by midnight. And it's very easy to get here during the day from anywhere in Barcelona via the Metro. It's one of the best in Europe. The hotel, itself, however was very nice.</div><div class='text-box'>Went for this hotel after reading reviews on this site, and was not disapointed. The hotel is easy to get to from the airport as the train goes straight from the airport to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the train station below the hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The station also has</span> many places to eat and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>easy access to the metro and the tourist bus</span>. The staff were friendly and were able to get us a reservation at the city's top mexican restaurant at short notice. Rooms were nice and bright with large windows and we had a good view of the city below. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The thing about this hotel is its convenience. The train from the airport goes directly to Sants station and the hotel has an entrance inside the station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is only one stop on the metro to the Ramblas</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel sits on top of the station</span> but you are totally unaware of noise from the trains. The rooms are functional, modern and comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>We were well pleased with our stay there</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>barcelo sants is ideally located above the main station to and from the airport</span>. it also has great links to the metro and you can get to anywhere in Barcelona in only a short time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel</span> itself <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is very modern</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the rooms are spacious</span> and well appointed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we</span> have been here before and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would choose this one again</span> due to its central location.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">It is a modern business hotel on top of the train station and totally sterile and charmless, and Barcelona has so many neighborhoods to stay in that are totally charming that I can't see the point of making the trip to stay at the Sants.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The rooms, however, are big, very clean and reasonably priced.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">You will have to take the bus or metro to see the sights.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">And you will have to go to the Placa Espana</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">if you want to take the train to Monserrat, there is no direct train from the Sants train station, although you can take the Metro to the Placa.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">I recommend staying in the Barri Gotic.</span></div></div>
