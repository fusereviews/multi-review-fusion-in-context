<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Not a 4-star hotel. We stayed here as part of a group tour through northern Italy. Of the 21 rooms occupied by our group, at least 7 rooms had problems such as foul odors and non-functioning air-conditioning and the occupannts requested a room change. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The first room we were given was tiny</span> the a/c didn't work. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room they gave us next was handicap-accessible and was much larger</span>, with a huge bathroom. The bathroom, however, had no put-down space at all we had to move a small table from the bedroom into it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The neighborhood is very seedy and we were uncomfortable walking around there at night</span>. There are better choices in beautiful Florence.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL</span> This hotel has the most uncaring staff I've ever witnessed. Our hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>room was burglarized while we slept in our beds</span>. No one was injured thankfully, but the hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>displayed a no-care attitude</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>They never sent a staff person</span> up to the room when we called down to report the intrusion. They <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>made us wait while they checked people in and out</span> before giving us the insurance forms to fill out <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>and made us wait</span> once <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>again</span> while they copied the forms for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>They never apologized</span> and basically treated us like we didn't exist. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Stay away from this one</span> - there's plenty of hotels in Florence.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great little hotel</span> We stayed in a triple room for 4 nights april 10 -14,the hotel was great very clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the staff very helpfu</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had no problem with the area at all</span> ,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>iit was very convenient as we were traveling by train</span>,just cross the street and you are there,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>also the buses on the other side of the station to go to Fiosole,plaza Michelangelo and the discount mall outside of Florence.the</span> breakfast was very good for that size hotel,we did not expect that good selection,the restaurant next door for a late dinner or snack is great.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I will stay here again and really recommend it</span></div><div class='text-box'>Well located good hotel We were a little apprehensive booking this hotel because of some negative reviews. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>selected it because of its convenient</span> location and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Wewere pleasantly surprised</span>. The room was clean and decent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>The staff was very friendly and accomidating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The location is perfect</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>if you arrive by train</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>all attractions are easily reachable by foot</span>. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Don't recommend this hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is much older than the pictures on their website</span>. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>room is facing to a construction site</span>. The worst thing is that the construction site started to have someone hammering at 8 or 9am so I had to wake up by 8 or 9 am. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The sound insulation was not good</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>only thing that i like is the location</span>. very convenient.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Good location, but that's all</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>A great location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>beside the road from train station</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>walking distances from Florence tourist attractions</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is old little neglected</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the rooms are small</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>price is excellent but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>you get what you pay</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Big deal It's an excellent option : <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>very close to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>train station</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>city main attractions</span>. If you don't want to spend so much, but need a clean and confortable hotel with a good breakfast, you can try this one</div><div class='text-box'>Whatever you do , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>DON"T STAY HERE</span>! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>cigarette butts</span> they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>left on the balcony</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel seems older than its website's information suggests and is not recommended.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Arriving by train makes it easy to access this hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It's ideally situated because you can access plenty of attractions by walking there</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">but it's also really close to buses if wanting to go further afield.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms aren't big and some will face a construction site.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Furthermore they aren't even safe.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The staff were not terribly helpful and would keep people waiting during checking-in and checking-out.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There was no apology after an incident and generally the hotel staff gave a no-care attitude.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">You get what you pay for in this hotel - the sound insulation was lacking and there were cigarette butts just left on the balcony.</span></div></div>
