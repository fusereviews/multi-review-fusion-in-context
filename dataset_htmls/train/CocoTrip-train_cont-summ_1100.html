<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location of this hotel is in the heart of the industrial market of Istanbul,</span> but that should not deter you from staying here for business or leisure. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is ideal for tourists too because of its proximity to the peninsua, golden horn and beyoglu. Everything is within walking distance</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Excellent connectivity by bus or the tram</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The metro is not far off either</span>. I would recommend that one takes rooms ont he higher levels because they then offer excellent views of the golden horn. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast is not that great</span> but their roof top restaurant serves excellent seafood. Service is prompt and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the staff is very courteous</span>. Other than the people int he reception, nobody knows English. I'll definitely be staying here the next time too.</div><div class='text-box'>My friends and I arrived to Golden City Hotel only to realize we had incorrectly made our reservation for one week later.

The streets and alleys coming down from Galata are a little dark at night but we never felt unsafe walking home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Would stay again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>This hotel is located on a perfect location: in between the old city and the modern part</span> of the city <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>with a great view on the river and the mosques</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rooms are not big but big enough</span> with everything you need.
