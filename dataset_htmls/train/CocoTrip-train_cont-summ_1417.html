<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Caravel on 14 - 16 March. Hotel was clean and tidy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Not in the city centre</span>, but only 10 minute walk from Metro and then a 10 minute metro journey. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Bus stop just a few minutes away</span>. Plumbing was noisy as were some of the other guests (on the Saturday night). Hotel is on a busy street with lots of traffic - although we were not facing the road and it wasn't too bad. Continental <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast was</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>good</span>. Alcohol prices not bad for hotel, but barman did try to over-charge us and was seen doing the same to another customer - so check bills! All in all, this hotel just about did the trick for our purpose (rugby Italy v Wales) for the price paid.</div><div class='text-box'>I traveled to Rome for 3 days. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The location of the hotel is not great,</span> it is quite far from the metro station, and the bus service in Rome is complicated. Besides this, the personel from the hotel is steeling youre clothes and personal things. The lady who came into our room to clean, stoled a pair of pants and a pack of cigarets, later on I asked a lady who was working there, and she said that this is not for the first time that it has happend, that it is was a very comune situation. They did not give any kind of compensation, more than that, they were looking at us like some kind of trouble makers. FOR SURE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO CARAVEL AGAIN!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I liked very much that Hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>It has a very good location</span>, 10 minutes from the metro station Garbatella from where you can go in all the places. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The breakfast was delicious</span>, we also had a mini-fridge with 2 bottles of mineral water wich were exactly what we needed when we used to arrive at 11 pm in the room. There is also a supermarket near this Hotel. A very nice and polite girl cleaned our room every morning and we were very happy with that. In the room there were very beautiful pictures with views of the city of Rome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I will definitely stay again there and I hope the conditions will remain the same</span>. Thank you for everything ! The Christmas in Rome was a dream and it came true !</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for two nights at the Caravel as a part of a Cosmos tour to Italy & Greece. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Overall its a decent pick for the location</span> and proximity to the Colosseum and (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>25 minutes away by bus</span>) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Pantheon, Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Expect this hotel to be somewhat like a Days Inn or Howard Johnson</span>. Go here if you are on a budget and are looking to crash for a few nights and stay out most of the day. Our rooms were relatively clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the breakfast buffet was not too bad</span>. The negatives are - Out dated room from the 80's, hotel staff who did not help when asked for directions and noise from the road outside.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here on the first leg of our Cosmos tour to Rome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was extremely tiny</span> and very basic. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was</span>n't the cleanest or the most comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>just very basic</span>. There was quite a bit of noise from our neighbours. Sadly, the lady in the reception wasn't so helpful in helping us find our way around Rome, so we mostly relied on our guide book. That said, the hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>just</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>a 10 min bus ride from central Rome</span>, where all the touristi-stuff is, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the location was great</span>. Also, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the continental breakfast</span> at this hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was pretty decent</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the hotel is very bad located</span>. Far away of everything.and the bus service in Rome is complicated because of the traffic. So we wasted a lot of time in the buses trying to get to the downtown instead of have fun and actually known the spectacular city of Rome. Besides the receptionist were not nice. always mad at everything. And the hotel is old and the rooms not so clean. I would not get back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>We booked this hotel last November for a stay of 7 nights from 7th May through alpharooms.com. On arrival we were told that we could not stay and were directed to Hotel Bled. Although the same grade <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>it was very shabby and the room</span> allocated <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>had</span> no waste plug for the washbasin and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>no hot water</span>. We eventually managed to get the manager to transfer us to Hotel Torino. This was a vast improvement.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights at the Caravel, was very clean and tidy, rooms cleaned and beds made/fresh towels on a daily basis. Staff friendly and helpful. Continental <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast was nice</span>. Hairdryers in rooms were rubbish though! Bus stop down the road taking you to all major attractions, although there wasnt much to do in the local area everything closed quite early. Would stay there again.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is very basic at best.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were quite small and needed updating,especially the bathrooms.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The beds were quite comfortable and the included breakfast was adequate.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The worst thing about the Hotel for us was the location.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">It was in the commercial part of Rome,a bus ride away from the centre.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">If you there on a Sunday - everything around will be closed.</span></div></div>
