<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>After reading earlier reviews I was concerned that the facilities and expereince would not be as nice as I had hoped. From the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 6'>description of the room</span> we rented I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 6'>thought it would be tight quarters</span>. I was pleasantly surprised to find <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 8'>the atmosphere and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5 8'>facilities</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 8'>to be</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5 8'>excellent</span>. We stayed in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>small suite</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>bedroom</span> and a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>pull out couch</span>. We had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 8'>plenty of room</span> and were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 8'>very comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 6 8 10'>The pull out couch was of excellent quality</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6 8 10'>slept</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 6 8 10'>better than some beds</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>I have expereinced during travels</span>. We stayed during the John Hagee ministeries event. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>The Chateau staff did an excellent job</span> handling the large crowd staying at the hotel and those that came in for the sessions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 6'>The Chateau</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>made a nice Spring Break destination</span> for these Michigan travelers.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed last weekend and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was disappointed over some details</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7 8'>Room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>413</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7 8'>was very noisy.too close to heating/AC units</span>. Also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7 8'>room was right above delivery area</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>which contributed to the noise</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Overall</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 8'>not a very welcoming feeling at the Chateau</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>Coffee pot would not work</span> and when I called to request another <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>the woman at the front desk was rude</span> and didn't seem to believe me. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>The doormen were unpleasant and wouldn't even smile</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'> especially the one in the afternoon</span>. I come to Branson often to visit family and for vacations and I'm sorry to say this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>will not be my choice of hotel in the future</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I stayed here before he deployed with the Army. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>It was so peaceful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3 4 5'>The area is beautiful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 8'>The staff went out of their way to make our stay something to remember</span>. Some of the small details of this resort really make a difference. The ice cream shop packed up banana spits for us to take to our room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 9'>The cafe restaurant had the best food</span>. We can't wait to go back. Waking up to the chirping birds and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 10 11'>the trickle of the water in the indoor atrium made for a nice touch</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Branson, stayed at Chateau on the Lake. It's about 10 minutes past the main strip of Branson activities but it's worth the drive for the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>gorgeous views</span> and lovely relaxing hotel. For the price and service level of the hotel, I did expect to have a mini fridge (empty or stocked) but our room type (king lakeview) did not have one. We took advantage of the great weather and hotel bar and had a glass of wine out on the deck. So lovely!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>This was everything that i could of asked for</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 8'>Nice people</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>nice scenery</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>it was to die for</span>. I most definitely will be back here again! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the food was expensive</span>. but i expected that. pull is 24hours. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10 11'>they also had a movie theater</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'> mainly showed kids movies</span> but they still had one.</div><div class='text-box'>When we pick up our daughter from a nearby camp we always stay at the Chateau and get a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>special room service dinner</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>beds are</span> so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>comfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 9'>we</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 9'>enjoy the room service</span> very much.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>We</span> went for our one year anniversary and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>had a fabulous time</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4 5'>The resort was stunning</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 10'>spa was lovely</span> as well!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4 5'>Everything about</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 3 4 5'>the resort was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4 5'>perfect</span>!
