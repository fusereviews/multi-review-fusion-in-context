<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the Locanda Sant'Agostin in January '06, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we were very impressed with the quality and friendliness of the service we received</span>. Our room was very quiet, if not a little cold, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! Breakfast was basic continental style, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would recommend this hotel</span> to anyone who wants to experience Venice, you really can walk anywhere from the Hotel, the Rialto Bridge and St Marks are only a few minutes walk away. A brilliant holiday - thank you Locando Sant'Agostin we'll be sending our parents your way next year!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>My husband and I</span>, as well as another couple reserved 2 rooms on the internet and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were very happy with the accommodations</span>. They were clean, comfortable, charming, centrallly located, and breakfast was a nice start to the day with yoghurt, cappuccino, coissants, cereal. The rooms were decorated with old world charm and the bathrooms were newly upgraded. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was very friendly</span> and helpful. The location was walking distance to all of Venice. It is easiest to take a water taxi or the walk has many bridges and steps for you to navigate with your luggage. -Great value. Loved Venice and Locanda Sant'Agostin Loretta and Vincent</div><div class='text-box'>Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel; it is all about service and making sure the guests are comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff are</span> so helpful and so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>pleasant</span>. We stayed in the apt nearby and found it spacious and clean, and it gave us a flavour of how Venetians live. The hotel is away from the main tourist drag but it is still in a great location, not far from the water-ferry station and Rialto,and quite close to a couple of great restaurants.</div><div class='text-box'>The Locanda Sant'Agostin was a delight in every way. The hotel is a historic beauty with a pleasant surprise of a large spacious room and bathroom. The location was ideal; situated off a quiet plaza but within easy walking distance to our destinations.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was very friendly and helpful</span>; their English speaking skills were somewhat limited but not problematic. Our stay was very pleasant and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I highly recommend this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the apartment next to the hotel which was spacious, comfortable and clean and a great price for Venice. Breakfast next door at the hotel was lovely and the breakfast lady is very warm and friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff at reception could not have been more helpful</span>, booking us tickets to a concert, recommending places to visit and restaurants to eat. Would definitely come back and stay again.</div><div class='text-box'>A nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly atmosphere</span>. Everyone were very helpful in helping us with arrangement of a water taxi pickup early Sunday morning. It is located so you can easily (< 5 min) reach the places where the Venezians go out. I am sure that we will consider this place, the next time we go to Venezia.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel was ideally located in the centre of Venice but in a nice quiet situation. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were all very friendly</span> and helpful, and the hotel was spotlessly clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would certainly recommend this hotel</span> and when I return to Venice will look no further.</div><div class='text-box'>ideal place to stay right in the heart of real Venice clean comfortable and elegant rooms very good breakfast <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very efficient and helpfull staff</span> definetely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>i will stay again in my nxt visit</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel are friendly and the hotel is recommended.</span></div></div>
