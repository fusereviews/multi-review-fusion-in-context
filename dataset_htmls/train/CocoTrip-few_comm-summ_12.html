<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We made a trip through Europe by car and stayed for two nights in this charming hotel. The hotel is as close as can be to the (as far as I know) only public parking on the island, so we did not have to drag luggage through the entire city center, a serious advantage considering that, at night, you can spot desperate travellers pulling their bags over the bridges, swearing and sweating. The hotel is a charme, located in an old monastery with a beautiful garden, a large bar in the old refectory (with an intact pulpit). Kids slept (4 & 7) with us in a large room with high ceilings, clean with good beds. The guys at the reception are friendly and funny. The breakfast was rich. The station of the grand canal "vaporetto" is very close by, as is in fact the entire city center. Overall, a greate place to stay, visiting Venice with our without small children (and certainly if you came by car).</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. If you like luxury, I wouldn't stay here but it was a great value for the price. The location is great and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff are very helpful</span>. It is only a block from train station and one of the main lines of the vaporetti so you can always catch a boat back home. It does get flooded but the hotel has boots for you to borrow. The breakfast was okay, it is a standard European continental breakfast. The lobby also has free wireless and you can borrow one of their laptops.</div><div class='text-box'>Great hotel, conveniently located near the train station, no need to struggle with luggage on the boats. Easy to get to anywhere else. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff were</span> great and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very helpful in all respects</span>. Room was great, plenty of space (although we did get an upgrade for our anniversary present) Breakfast in the garden a must. Note this is the only hotel I have ever stayed in (and that is a lot) where the mini bar prices seem to be more favourable than outside. (Odd but true) Would definitely stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location close to the station but still in a quiet backwater. Perfect for exploring Venice. Friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful staff</span> - the free map was very welcome! Small but perfectly adequate room - no view but then I wasn't paying for one! Charming garden for breakfast. Air conditioning very welcome during sizzling August.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for four nights at the Hotel Abbazia and couldn't have been more impressed. The rooms were huge and very clean, breakfast was wonderful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff could not have been more helpful or pleasant</span>. It was very convenient to the ACTV and the train station.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel provides an excellent service for the site seeing traveller. It is in a great location right next to the station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were</span> very friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span>. The rooms are basic but spacious and clean. We would certainly recomend this hotel!</div><div class='text-box'>We loved staying at Hotel Abbazia as it is good value for money, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff are very friendly & helpful</span>, lovely breakfast and good location near the Grand Canal and St Lucia station. Good, reasonably priced food venues handy too.</div><div class='text-box'>Just returned from a second stay in the Abbazia. Hotel staff very friendly. Could not fault anything. Great location and yet so quiet (well apart from the church bell!). Just lovely!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful.</span></div></div>
