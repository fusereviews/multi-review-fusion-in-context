<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We have just spent 4 great nights at this hotel. My wife is in a wheel chair and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the room was fully accessible, the bath is even wider in the middle so you can turn round in the shower</span>. All the staff were very friendly and the doors were always opened for us before we got there, even when it was snowing like mad - Thanks everyone. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>You must visit the Rock Bottom Brewery just around the corner</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>- the burgers are great and huge</span>, the main courses are elegant and sophisticated and the carrot cake is big enough to use as a building brick - but a lot tastier! BUT the main attraction is the great beers available all local brews and tasting great. Again would recommend this hotel to everyone, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>they were still filling up the breakfast racks with 5 minutes to go (Finish -10 am weekdays, 11 am weekends), and fresh coffee is always available in the breakfast room</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>1. Neighborhood is great and safe. 2. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Lots of local bars a couple streets over</span> on Wells and Clark all the way up to Chicago Ave. 3. Every employee greeted us nicely, not a negative person in the place! 4. 160 a night more than I'm used to but had a free night coupon so helped 5. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast included to get the day going</span> 6. I would stay here again, we had a great time!</div><div class='text-box'>We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>got to the hotel early</span> in the morning <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>and they let us check in</span> at aronud 9 am. It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a block away from the Grand Train Station</span> (red line), so you can get anywhere from there. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was</span> so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>complementary breackfast buffet</span> is really good. The employees have excelent knowledge of the nearby good restaurants. It was a pleasant stay.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel suites are very large considering you are in downtown Chicago. Our king suite had a full size refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, and dishes. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>They provided free breakfast</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>free coffee and tea 24 hours a day</span>. The location is very convenient and a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>need a little remodeling</span>, though, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>are clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and comfortable</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel staff were very friendly and competent . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The hotel is clean</span> and our room was fine. The location of the hotel is good, it's about a 2 block walk to the red line subway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast is served from 6-10AM</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast bar is very popular with families</span>. If you plan to eat after 8AM be prepared to deal with a swarm of children.</div><div class='text-box'>I was in Chicago for a meeting and I was staying in Hampton Inn and Suites for one week. It it very close to Michigan Ave (Magnificent miles) less than 5-10 min walking, very close to the subway. Everything was perfect. So If I come back to Chicago I'll stay there</div><div class='text-box'>The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>hotel was</span> great - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>clean</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> attractive</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable</span>. It's in a terrific location. The staff went above and beyond - friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable, and just very very nice. They were all wonderful - we particularly enjoyed speaking with Janita Walton. We would definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Hotel was clean</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> spacious</span>, good location and good value for money. Only criticism I would say is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it's right next to the fire department, therefore can be a little noisy</span> at times, certainly not enough to stop me coming back. Overall, very good.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was attractive and clean.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated next to the train station but also next to the fire department which can make it noisy.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There are lots of bars nearby.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, although perhaps in need of a slight touch up and redecoration.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The room had good disabled access, including the bath.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides a free breakfast buffet in the morning, as well as free hot drinks all day, which is popular with families staying.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is also close to Rock Bottom Brewery, which serves really good food.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel can provide early check-in instead of waiting later, which was a nice gesture.</span></div></div>
