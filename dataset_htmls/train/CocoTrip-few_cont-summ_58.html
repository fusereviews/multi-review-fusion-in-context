<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Would NEVER Stay There Again I booked this Queen as part of a package from Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. The flight (Delta) was packed but ok. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room at the Queen REEKED of mold</span>. We couldn't get another room, they claimed to be 100% full (actually, they told us they always overbook 3-5%).I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>took apart the air conditioner, cleaned out a bunch of black fungus/mold</span> and bought a can of Lysol at ABC store for $8.It helped a little, but not much.I called Pleasant, they claimed they couldn't help me and that I was better off at the counter.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you stay here, remember you're paying $50/night in a $150 neighborhood and that the facility is old, moldy, overbooked, and that they don't have much for customer service</span>.By the way, I think Pleasant Holidays is off my list too becase of their complete lack of support.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A Good Deal</span> Stayed for 4 nights and had a really good stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Friendly, helpful staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Tour/Activities staff in lobby very knowledgeable</span>. Poor points are very limited parking and having to go to basement to get a pool towel from Housekeeping versus poolside on 3rd floor. The AC units chill your room quickly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Breakfast buffet good deal for the money and their dinners are just as good as any other restaurant</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Excellent location (beach, zoo, aquarium, shopping, etc</span>) and easy to find. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Rooms are dated</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span> and larger than you'd expect for the price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would definitely stay there again</span> and plan to do so!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Getting Pretty Bad Liike every one has said</span> , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location</span> view <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>are wonderful</span> , but then there's your room and the slow elevators. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms need a new face lift</span> bad and the bathrooms are getting gross, I went to have breakfast with my family, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a elevator they where leaving the restraunt by the time I got there. And <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the tile around the pool is VERY SLIPPERY</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>my grandchildren fell many times</span>. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would recommend this hotel only if it's all you can afford</span> and you want to be close to the beach.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great hotel good value</span> We stayed at Queen Kap for 11nights to the 09 sept 04. It was great we requested an ocean view studio with kitchenette. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The room</span> was on the 8th floor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>had a view of</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>diamond head, beach, pool and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>zoo</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>It was old but clean</span> and very comfortable, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>reasonably priced</span> with every 5th night free and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>free buffets thrown in everyday too</span>! Check their websites for specials. We will be staying there again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>its old</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but good and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>staff are friendly</span> but request a room with a view and pay the extra! Mahalo</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wonderful Value</span> - Good for GLBT Customers <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and the W Hotel, then this place is not for you</span>. But, if you want a wonderful bargain right in the heart of Waikiki, this is great! And if you are a GLBT customer, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you are right next door to Hula's and across the street from Queen's Surf Beach</span>. I would definitely stay again. I got a great deal too. Stay 3 nights and get the 4th night free.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Nice stay This was a pretty nice hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location was great and very convenient</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The amenities</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were nothing fancy</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>definitely adequate</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We got a balcony that overlooked the city and ocean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>a sizeable bathroom</span>; I couldn't really ask for more. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is definitely not a luxury palace</span>, but I doubt anyone booking this hotel expects that!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Can't Recomment</span> This hotel is in need of a big makeover, standard rooms are really small, seems some motels have better rooms than their standard rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Service was good</span>, but thats about it for this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>happy with the Queen Kap! photo from our balcony</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Whilst not the most luxurious hotel it is still a really good stay here and recommended based on the affordability.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Convenient location for closeness to shops, the zoo, and the aquarium.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The view from the room at this hotel was great</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">however it didn't make up for the tired decor and the low standard of cleaning here.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The staff service was pretty good and they clearly know lots of information about the area.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides a complimentary buffet.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has got a pool but unfortunately the tiles there are really slippery and quite a hazard.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Other facilities are adequate enough.</span></div></div>
