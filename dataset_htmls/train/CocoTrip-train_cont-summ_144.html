<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for 7 nights and found the Excalibur to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a very good hotel</span>. We stayed in tower 2 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>our room was very spacious</span> and very comfortable. The hotel itself is very busy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>has a lot of amenities</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The buffet breakfast was great</span>, we did not try lunch or dinner. The coffee bar at the entrance to tower 2 was fantastic and is open 24 hours. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Excalibur is located quite far down the south of the strip</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it is very close to New York New York, Luxor</span>, MGM <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and the Mandelay Bay</span>. There is a tram or a moving walkway from the Excalibur that will take you to the luxor and the Mandelay Bay.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Excalibur for 3 nights just after Labor Day. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>rooms were</span> average but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very clean</span> and comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The first night we ate at the Round Table buffet, which was good as far as buffets go. You won't go away hungry</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The second night we went to the "Tournment of Kings.'' It was very entertaining and the food was pretty good</span>. The third night we ate at the Sherwood Cafe. The food was very good and lots of it for the money. We had no problems during our stay. The check-in kiosks are very convenient and it didn't look like too many people were taking advantage of them.</div><div class='text-box'>Recently stayed at the Excalibur in Tower 2. We had a widescreen <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>room on the 23rd Floor overlooking</span> the MGM Grand and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>New York-New York</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms</span> are very comfortable and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>are cleaned daily</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Loads of choices of places to eat in the hotel</span> along with the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>links to Luxor and Mandalay Bay</span>. We stayed during CES week and the food venues were pretty busy in the morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Would definately stay there again</span> if <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the price is right due to the location</span>. The only annoying part was having to say no every 5 minutes to people offering you 'Free Show Tickets'.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at the Excalibur for 2 nights. It was our first visit to Las vegas and would use the Excalibur again. My husband and I found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff courteous and friendly</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the room spacious, clean and tidy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The food was excellent especially the breakfast buffet</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>it was situated</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>ideally at the south end of the strip</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>by the New York, New york</span>, MGM <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and The Luxor</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>Was very good value for money</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> Will rebook again on our next visit</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>First of all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the price of this hotel was outstanding</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was clean</span> and the bed was somewhat comfortable. We upgraded to the widescreen view room. It was worth the few extra dollars. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>service was great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff was</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>friendly</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location was just ok</span>. Even though <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it was on the strip</span> I found myself going on a journey to find good food and entertainment. All in all I would say it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was a great stay</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Las Vegas! We stayed in TOWER 2 (upgraded) and loved it! The pool is so awesome! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Tournament of kings dinner show is off the hook</span>! I took a 12, 10 and 5 year old with us and we all loved it. The pool was fun! I really liked the Food court! So convenient! We also did <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the Dinner Buffet</span> that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was good</span> to for the price.</div><div class='text-box'>This was our first time staying in Las Vegas. We had a great time and we thought everything at the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel was great</span>. All the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>personnel</span> we encountered <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>friendly</span>. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was</span> very nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span> and we had a great view of the strip. We ate several times <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>at the buffet</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the food was good</span>. The only downfall was that the slots were tight! We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>would</span> definatly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>stay here again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Excalibur may be down in the far end of the strip but it's still on the strip and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for the price you can't really beat it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's close to the luxor and mandalay bay</span>. We didn't get to see the tournament show and the casino is not that bad either.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a great hotel, it is located in the heart of Las Vegas, for the price and location you cant beat it.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is close to the Luxor, New York New York and the Mandela Bay.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The staff was friendly and accommodating.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were very clean and spacious; The food at the buffet was very good, they had a lot of food choices.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">There is also a Tournament of Kings dinner show, where the food is good and the show is even better.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">I would definitely stay at this hotel again!</span></div></div>
