<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 5 day visit to Amsterdam. The location is very good, being right next to Central Station, but can be a little far from some of the tourist spots such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff very polite</span>. However, on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was. The towels that we were promised immediately upon complaining turned up over 2 hours later. At no point were we offered anything to appease us, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff</span> simply apologised and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were ineffectual</span>, although polite. This was disappointing, as apart from this, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>stay was extremely pleasant</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the mint hotel/ doubletree by hilton. All I can say is that the rooms were suberb. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Very friendly staff at reception</span> and breakfast was a delight. Unfortunately, room service needs to improve as our expectations were not managed. Food took longer to arrive and had to keep chasing. Also we were told that the kitchen is closed after 45mins of putting our order. However, the rooms and freindliness of the reception/ breakfast team make up for it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Extremely good value for money</span> and will stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>Just back from a short trip to the doubletree for my husbands 30th birthday, what a lovely hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Staff were friendly and helpful</span> and rooms were modern and clean, also plenty of choice at breakfast time. We visited the sky lounge on the 11th floor, it had a nice chilled atmosphere but we only had one drink there as it was VERY expensive! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>All in all great hotel</span> in great location, would not hesitate in staying there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Amsderdam Mint as had previously stayed at the Leeds Mint & enjoyed the experience. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Staff were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span> & <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>friendly</span>, had made a note on booking form was our Wedding Anniversary + my birthday received a bottle of wine in room, also complimentary Continental breakfast each day. Hotel very central, more hotels being built nearby so maybe some disruption? Although we didn`t have any problems.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights for the football at Ajax hotel is in a great location for the train station and the Metro which you can take direct to the stadium, hotel even sells metro tickets. room was great, Apple tv is fantastic and the bed is the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>most comfortable i have</span> ever <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had</span> whilst <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staying away</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff all very helpful</span>, will definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is an excellent hotel</span>, central for everywhere in Amsterdam Rooms are lovely, but even with an upgrade they are still small. Lovely White Company toiletries. We had a lovely view and the balcony is a bonus. Breakfast is fantastic. You wont need to eat till teatime. Will def re-visit.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in this hotel for a weekend break and was very impressed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is lovely</span>, very stylish with fantastic views (we had a room on the 7th floor). The location is ideal - only minutes from town.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Awesome hotel</span> next to Central Station? Must eat at sky lounge at top of hotel. It over looks the entire city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Perfect location</span> to all tourist attractions.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is worth the money because the stay was exceptional.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly.</span></div></div>
