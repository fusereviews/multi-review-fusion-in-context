<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I visited Toronto end of May and stayed in this hotel with a colleague. The hotel is situated in the city centre of Toronto. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms in the hotel were cleaned and spacious. The bedding was very nice; the bathroom was modern</span> with marble unit top and the toiletries were of good quality. The corridor had also an ice machine which I thought was very good idea, for those who like their cold water any time of the day. The breakfast in the hotel was also good, with a good choice of food. Newspapers were delivered to you in the morning and the staffs were very pleasant and helpful. The hotel also had a bar with a dancing floor and this was quite handy for us as we could drink and dance in. I will go there again if I ever go to Toronto and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>will definitely recommend it</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We stayed at this hotel</span> for 7 nights <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and had a fantastic time</span>. The hotel is very nice and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 8th floor and it was a very good size and the bathroom was spacious. We had breakfast in the Market Garden, it was great with a very good choice. I found the hotel to be very quiet even although it is a very busy hotel. The location of this hotel is great. It is a 2 minute walk to the Eaton Centre (which is great) and about 20 -25 minute walk down to Front Street for the CN Tower.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at the Delta Chelsea in Toronto many many times over the past years and have never been disappointed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The quality of this hotel is second to none</span> and the location is perfect. close to everything "downtown". as well as transit . The rooms are well kept, clean. and the beds are incredibly comfortable. If I have one negative comment regarding this hotel it would be that the restaurant is very expensive. I find myself going out to eat meals while staying at the Delta Chelsea. All in all. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I always enjoy my stay at this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I visited TO for my birthday. The Delta Chelsea prestige clerk didnt have any interest in doing something special for my birthday (Montreal Delta Centerville are more then happy to give wonderful experience for celebrations!) Even though it was written on my reservation I was there for my bday; I had to verbally remind them and they didnt seem too interested. Got a few balloons and 2 chocolate strawberries. Woohoo! In the morning I finally got them to give me free breakfast. Rm was clean and for most part comfortable</div><div class='text-box'>enjoyed a week for business, especially enjoyed the spa next door Elmwood Spa - they give a discount if show your room key. the curry's at lunch time in the bistro are great as is the affordable food in the cafe part. Pub i didn't like too much . but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the restaurant is excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>business services are really good</span> - make sure you get an upgraded room and that been renovated as some are looking rather tired. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great staff, very friendly</span></div><div class='text-box'>The room was small and definitely in need of a makeover. The bathroom was very small and very much in need of a makeover. I am sure both were clean, but they did not seem to be clean because they are so dingy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>At $300 for one night, I was grossly over charged</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for the weekend of November 4-6. Got a last minute deal and was happy with the location. There is some construction nearby so be warned of the noise in the early morning. Close to all amenities.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Enjoyed the</span> Delta <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>experience</span>, will definately come back. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>retaurant staff were outstanding</span>, epecially the chef on duty.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is very recommended and it is an excellent hotel to stay at.</span></div></div>
