<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I have stayed here three times -all on business trips</span> where the hotel was booked for me. In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11 12'>The two lifts are small and infrequent</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='12'> and so you may have to wait a long time</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>which is annoying if you are on the top floors</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>location is great for seeing Barcelona</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>-you can reach most of the central sights by foot -including the Gaudi cathedral. Very near to a metro line</span> , which is also a bonus. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6 10'>Rooms are fine</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 10'>-just try to get one facing the courtyard at the back</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6 10'>-the ones to the front can be noisy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Biggest disappointment was the breakfast -17 for a very poor selection - definitely not worth it</span>. I didn`t bother after the first morning.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a really good deal on the rooms at this hotel and, therefore, it was worth what we paid for it. However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I would have been dissapointed if we had payed full price</span> for this. We went in january which I know is not in season however, the terraces were closed and the pools were not open. They were also doing refurbishment works to one of the terraces, none of this was really communicated until you checked in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The room was a reasonable size</span> as we had one at the end of a corridor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the bed was comfy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The bathrooms however, need some updating</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>they were tired and not in the best condition</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 10'>Also be warned if you stay on the front of the hotel, the spanish like to beep their horns and this can be disturbing</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Second time in this hotel and kinda disappointed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Rooms are ok</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it is a good value for money mainly due to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>the great location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>on Paseig de Gracia</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>the service does not seem to care</span> so much about their customers. They are physically present behind the desk, but it stops here. It seems that they are breathing boredom. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you go to Barcelona</span> for a short weekend <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and do not plan to spend too much time at the hotel, it'll be alright</span>. If not, i'm sure you can pick a better place where the service will show you a more positive and customer focused attitude.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The hotel staff was very helpful</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>rooms very modern with everything that we could think of</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>It is a short walk away from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and a bit longer to la Sagrada Familia,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>the location couldn't be better</span>!<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'></span> Within a couple of blocks it has many restaurants to chose from and can't forget to mention that it's in a great shopping area. From now on <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the place where we'll stay when visiting Barcelona</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great hotel</span>! i can only think of a few things wrong with our stay, for one, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 9'>breakfast was not worth the price</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>paid</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>room service was a bit overpriced</span> as well, but with such a wide variety of other places to eat in barcelona, it didn{t really mattter much. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>standard room was small</span> but then again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the bed was huge</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>and the location. it can't get eny better</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4 5'>located</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>in a great location</span> however <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>is very expensive</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>If your looking for a place</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>near</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Gaudi's buildings and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>shopping areas</span>, then stay here.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>A lovely pillow menu</span>.WOW.rooms <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4 5'>excellent.location is very central and many many shops near the hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>staff very helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>A bit pricey but Lovely</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>Great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>place and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would defo stay here again</span>.
