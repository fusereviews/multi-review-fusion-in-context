<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We picked this hotel from the internet because of its proximatey to the Atoche Rail Station, as we were traveling on the fast train to Seville from that station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel was very clean</span> and the room was comfortable. For a large city we thought the cost was reasonable - ~$85.00 for a room with two twins. The bathroom was also very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>The staff were friendly and helpful</span>. If you wish to save money, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel can be reached from the airport by taking the metro to the Atoche Renfe Station</span> (You change lines twice) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is then about a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 10'>5-10 minute walk from the metro stop</span>/<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>train</span> station. The cost from the airport is 2 euro per person on the metro. It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>also</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 10'>within walking distance of the Prado</span> and Retiro Park.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed in this hotel in the middle of summer for 4 nights, overall we were happy with the hotel. Things we liked: - Location - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>very close to all major museums</span> and Madrid major park. Also well connected by metro to the rest of the city. The immediate area around the hotel doesnt offer much (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>very few</span> shops, cafes or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>restaurants</span>) but the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>close proximity to the city helps</span>. - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Service rooms are clean</span> and very comfortable. Nice beds. Bathrooms are big and clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>Hotel staff are friendly</span>. - Good value for money. Things we did not like: - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Internet in the foyer too expensive and slow. - No safes in the rooms</span>. Our stay was pleasant and comfortable, would definitely go back there.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in this hotel for a week and it couldn't have been better, it was ideally located for the metro. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel was</span> lovely and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>our room was cleaned every single day</span> but we were never disturbed by cleaners when we slept until the afternoon. It was quiet, had everything we needed and we had no complaints at all. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>The staff were efficient</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the restaurant</span>, which we ate in once and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>was</span> quite late at night served us with a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>lovely</span> meal and excellent wine. I think the people who may not have enjoyed this hotel are probably used to the 'holiday beach resort' type hotel and need to remember this is a city centre hotel more set up for business trippers than the 'benidorm crews'.</div><div class='text-box'>I spent four days in "Agumar" and both I and my friend were quite content with the quality of the room, the food and the service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It was clean</span> and comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the beds were soft and welcoming</span> after a day's walking and in the morning a rich and tasty breakfast gave us all the energy to explore Madrid and Toledo ( which is less than an hour away if you stay in this hotel ). Pros: nice area, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 10'>close to</span> a metro station and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 10'>the railway station</span>, good standard of service and qualified personnel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>We did not find any significant shortcomings and this is quite a compliment for the staff</span> because we are professional travellers - stewardesses.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>This hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Atocha train station</span>. It was perfect for a quick stay in Madrid where I needed to get the train stations 4 times in 3 days. The buses outside run near Sol and it was near the El Retiro park. Walking around was easy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 10'>it is about a 5 minute walk to some musuems</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and restaurants</span> . there is not much near the hotel but it is only a few minute walk to more action. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>The hotel staff was very helpful</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel was very</span> nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>. I booked using bancotel and paid 50 euros per night.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>This hotel is located very near the main train station</span>. The train station has the metro and the high-speed train to nearby cities. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>You can take one train to and from the airport to this train station (Atocha-Renfe)</span>. The walk at night to the hotel from the train station can be scary due to poor street lighting, but it is not a reflection of the neighborhood. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is</span> also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>very close to</span> the botanical gardens, el Parque del Retiro, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>El Museo del Prado</span>. The hotel staff were friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the hotel is very clean</span>. I highly recommend this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>This was a well located hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It was clean</span> and comfortable. Bus to center was right outside and the metro was a few blocks away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>The staff were very friendly and helpful</span>. We enjoyed our stay. The only negative was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>you had to pay to use the safe</span> deposit box in the room. Also, wifi was extra but that was not a big deal for us.</div><div class='text-box'>We only stayed here for one night but found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>the staff very helpful</span> and friendly the rooms were a good size and had everything we needed. It is in a nice location as it is a quiet area but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8 10'>very close to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>transport links</span>, bars and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>resturants</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>all of the museums</span>. The park is amazing and our favourite spot in Madrid.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">After staying at the Best Western Atlantico on Gran Via the Agumar Hotel was in a much quieter residential neighborhood.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Very close to the Prado and the Reina Sofia Museums and the Atoche Rail Station.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">5 min walk.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The Hotel seemed like a "tour group" hotel.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">It was very clean, but stark and cold.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">You had to pay for the use of the internet and also to use the safe.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The beer and wine were very expensive.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">better to go down the street to a local pub.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There was a restaurant there but again.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">expensive.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">Though we liked it for its proximity to the museums and the train.</span> <span id="11" class="summary-sentence">The staff were helpful.</span> <span id="12" class="summary-sentence">they had limited English.</span></div></div>
