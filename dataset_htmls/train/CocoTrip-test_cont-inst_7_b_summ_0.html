<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at parrot key before and was very impressed, so i booked agian, for fantasy fest, we stayed a total of three nights, I will say the location is not in the heart of downtown but that was one of my favorite things about <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel, a short taxi ride away from the choas of downtown</span> was our quite, spacious room. Where we could catch some well needed sleep. Last time we stayed we stayed <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>we were so impressed with the quilty bedding</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we spent the next day shopping for new sheets for our house</span>, sleeping at parrot key is like sleeping on a cloud, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I can't say enough about this place, staff is top- notch</span>,</div><div class='text-box'>From the very first <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>time I stayed there on a short pleasure weekend I feel in love with the resort</span>. I was looking to get away to a tropical place not far from my home in Fort Lauderdale and I found it. Relaxing in the pool, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>working out or sipping cocktails in one of the three great salt pools took me where I wanted to go to peace and tranquility</span> yet only three hours from home. I have been back now two more times and it's becoming my home away from home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I hghly recommend the resort and all of the staff memebers</span> Sean was the best ask for him when making your reservation. go and enjoy stop reading now. trust me!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at Parrot Key once before when it first opened and loved it, so I chose this property again when I needed a room in Key West for Fantasy Fest. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>grounds look</span> even more lush and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>beautiful</span> than before. From the road it's hard to tell what <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>paradise awaits you as you step into the property</span>. My sister and I had a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>two-level suite</span> that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>was fantastic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The front desk gave us all the inforamtion we needed</span> on the events and how to get to and from Duval during this busy time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>We absolutely loved it and will stay at Parrot Key again</span> next year!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed two nights in June. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The resort was excellent</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Staff and service was impeccable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The resort is the right mix of relaxation</span>. We spent most of our days relaxing in the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>4 beautiful pools and sitting by the outdoor bar</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is a bit of a drive away from duval street</span> but we weren't too keen on the drunks and parties that you find there so we were quite happy to relax at the resort. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We were upgraded to a two bedroom cottage and it was spectacular</span>! I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>would definitely go back to the</span> parrot key <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>resort again</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>We had the 3 bedroom <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>ocean view cottage</span>. Due to the lush foliage, the ocean is only visible from the decks off the upper rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are spacious and well furnished</span>. The only thing lacking is a washer/dryer and you could live there. The only reason I would not go back is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the price</span> - including the resort fee, the lowest rate available in February <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>was just under $600 per night</span> when booked months in advance. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We enjoyed our stay,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>but will try to find something less expensive next time</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>From the moment we checked in we were greeted by <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>very friendly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>helpful staff</span>. Oriana, Rutanya, and Shenali (sp) overextended themselves and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>made us feel more than welcome</span>, like we were at home. We are down for a birthday and the staff was helpful enough to recommend a bakery for a cake and set up the room fit for royalty. The atmosphere is beyond anything we expected. The property is lush and exotic. The rooms are very clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We will definitely be back</span> =)</div><div class='text-box'>We loved Parrot Key. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms</span> and grounds <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>were absolutely beautiful</span>. We especially loved the little porches. Everything was very clean and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>staff was extremely helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>friendly</span>. We also enjoyed the onsite jet ski tour! The only down side of Parrot Key is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the cab ride to Duval street/ mallory square</span> was about $15 each way which got <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>pretty expensive</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would defiantly stay at Parrot Key again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Great staff</span>, wonderful grounds, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>the pools are amazing</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Would def go back</span>! Trying to plan another trip for January!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The resort will have you wanting to keep coming back because it is really relaxing and welcoming.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was a short taxi ride away from the town centre.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It was quite a drive to Duval Street and this was rather expensive in a taxi.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room was beautiful and has amazing views.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">With regards to the bed in the room it had great quilted bedding.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">You could not wish for better staff service here because it is five-star.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">They were really helpful as well as friendly and welcoming.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There are some great salt pools where you can sip some cocktails and achieve some peace and tranquillity.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The price is quite steep however there are four amazing pools and an outdoor bar, so would definitely come back again.</span></div></div>
