<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I struggled to get accommodation for our wedding anniversary as it clashed with the Spanish Grand Prix. I found the Pere IV on one of my many trawls, so was a bit suspicious that they still had availability. What a lucky girl I am! The receptionist gave us the 'most romantic room' - a lovely 9th floor room with a terrace and a complimentary bottle of beautiful cava to help us celebrate our anniversary. The staff could not not have been more helpful and kind, willing to give advice on sights, restaurants, bars etc. Having a pool, jacuzzi and sauna was great after a days sightseeing, although the pool was a wee bit cool! The only downside was that it was a 10 min walk to get to the main tourist areas, although taxis are plentiful and fairly cheap and there is a metro station round the corner. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>An extremely good value for money hotel</span> which we would definitely use again.</div><div class='text-box'>An excellent hotel that delivers every time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is away from the city centre but by using the metro</span> (Bogatell located around the block) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you can be any where in the city in a very little time</span>. Use the T10 card and the metro is a cheap way to travel. The reception staff are exceptional,Crisanta, Yvonne,David and the other reception staff cannot do enough to make your stay an enjoyable one. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The cleaning staff also deserve recognition the rooms and public areas are immaculately clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast</span> in a lovely bright room <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>caters for the most fussy of eaters the choices available are so varied you cannot fail to leave the room satisfied</span> and content ready to start your sightseeing day. My room(double for single use) was of a medium size but had everything required for an enjoyable stay. I look forward to seeing Magnuss and his team again next year.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved this hotel, the spa is excellent (despite the additional cost) and the hotel is only a short walk from the metro, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the city centre (Ramblas etc) is only one or two stops away</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The area</span> is not as pristine and smart as the rest of the city, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>is very safe to walk late at night</span>, it appears to be an area that is not fully residential, however taxis are plentiful and bars / restaurants are within easy walking. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>La Sagrada Familia was the view from our window</span>, how brilliant to wak up to that! The staff and reception were incredibly friendly, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the hotel is very smart and clean</span>. We will definately stay here again when we visit in 2011.</div><div class='text-box'>Went to this hotel with a group of 18 of us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel is lovely</span>, the rooms were big <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and very clean</span>. The hotel staff were helpful and seemed really organised, they put our rooms next to each other on the same floor which was great and even let us check in early <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast was lovely lots to choose from</span>, when we were going home there was a safe locked room to put your cases. We all said we would definately stay at this hotel when we come again. Just a warning got a taxi from the hotel to the airport which was 24 going and for some reason 43 going back.</div><div class='text-box'>Me and my boyfreind stayed here for 3 nights and it was one of the comfiest sleeps ever. The bed was two double beds pushed together so it was really big! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>There was a complimentary mini bar</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'></span> not alcoholic though and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>there were only a few drinks and they don't top them up either</span> but meh! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast was awesome buffet with lots of pastries, bread and cheeses</span>:D The only things is that it's quite a walk into town. To wall to port olympic it's about 15 mins down a looong road. Then from Port Olympic it's another 15-20 mins to port vell.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel iseverything you expect frrom a 4 star hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Very clean and comfortable rooms</span> and good service with a smile from all the staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The area is mainly industrial but my wife and I walked everywhere and never felt any threat whatsoever</span>. It is about 10 mins walk to the port, 10 mins to Sagrada Familia and 15 mins to Ramblas.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for one night in the summer. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Well air conditioned comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>room with free mini bar</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room needed a few touch ups</span>, but on the whole was decent for a quick sleep and off out again. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast was very basic continental</span>. A pleasant experience, did the job.</div><div class='text-box'>The staff are very nice but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the place is very grubby and old fashioned</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The towels are like cardboard</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The area is</span> not nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a bit industrial</span>. Would not stay there again. More like a 3 star.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is good value for money and in a secure part of the city.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is in an industrial but safe area not too far from the city centre.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had air conditioned rooms with a mini bar and a view of the Sagrada Familia, but they needed a small touch up.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The cleaning staff made the hotel an incredibly clean environment.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">There was a complimentary mini bar included, although it was not restocked.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast served a selection of pastries, cheese and breads.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The towels in the hotel are too firm.</span></div></div>
