<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>For this trip to 'the dam' we wanted to be a bit more central, and we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hit jackpot with this hotel</span>. Right next to a canal, its around 5 mins walk to Dam square, and the same to Jordaan or the Nine Little Lanes. Leidsplein and other more interesting parts are also just a short walk away. The hotel itself is ok, it has a grand entrance hall with a reception desk <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staffed by smiley staff</span> members. The room was quite small, but large enough to cope with for just a few nights, but as the city was so close we hardly spent any time in there anyway. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff were helpful</span>, offering advice about what to see and do, and happy to look after cases after we checked out and went to get some lunch. Would stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed with friends on a business trip and the key to our room didnt work till after 6 attemps of the manager making new ones. it took 2 hours to get this sorted making us late for the important meeting we had and the deal fell through costing us a fortune. Next morning, the shower came alive and flew of the wall like a firemans hose, scallding each of us and having finally sorting this dangerous problem, we arrived 10 minutes late for breakfast and staff wouldnt serve us. staff then kept us waiting half an hour to check out with no real apoligy for our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>inconvieniences.staff very laid back and unintrested</span>. All in all a big dissapointment. Scallding cobra shower very dangerous.BE WARNED</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is exceptional</span>. For a 3 star Euro hotel the rooms are huge, the views of the canal (Herengeraacht) outside are atmospheric, the location, despite being very quiet is a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Dam Square, and only 5 minutes to Anne Franks House. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff were very helpful and friendly</span> despite the fact we turned up at gone midnight a little wiped from our day in Amsterdam. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>For the price this hotel really is head and shoulders above its peers</span>, which in Amsterdam can be very seedy. Always stay here when in the `Dam.</div><div class='text-box'>Don't fall for the scam of 'local tax' when checking out. Fifty euro deposit is taken when checking in for 'incidental' expenses. They then try and hold most of it back when you are leaving saying it is a local tax. We paid fully for our trip through a travel agent in UK before travelling so if the hotel have a problem with that they should take it up with them. Kick up a stink like we did and they will back down though. It makes you wonder how many people have been conned with this trick?</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Rembrandt Residence Hotel in April 2006. We found the hotel to be in a good location and our room was quite large. Bathrooom was also very big. We had a view of the canal which was wonderful although we could not figure out how to lock the windows. We were on the 2nd floor so it was not a problem. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff was very pleasant</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we enjoyed our stay. We would stay here again</span>. We thought the breakfast was a little less than we expected.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is in a very good location, just off a main street in central Amsterdam, on a quiet canal street. It is a 3 star hotel which may account for the stained carpeting, thin towels, and some snooty reception staff. The breakfast, although a reasonable price, was consistently out of items, had stale pastries and funny tasting eggs. Some of the rooms are tiny, so try to request a large room, if <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff will indulge your request</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the Rembrandt and found it to be comfortable and clean and in a fantastic location. It was quietly situated but within easy reach of everything we needed. Our rate included breakfast and a boat trip and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff were friendly and helpful</span>. The room wasn't huge but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for a 3* hotel in a central location it was great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would definitely stay again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>First time in Europe - good size room and bathroom, clean, lots of light, comfy bed <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>what more could you want</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would stay again</span> if went back to Amsterdam.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is worth the money because the stay was exceptional.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly.</span></div></div>
