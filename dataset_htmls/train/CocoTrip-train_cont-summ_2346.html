<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Very pleased that on arrival the gentleman in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>reception honoured my request for a room with a minimum of stairs as he allocated us a large ground floor room</span>. The room and bathroom were perfectly clean with the bathroom looking to be recently refurbished. The beds were comfortable and the towels provided of an unexpectedly good quality.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room and bathroom were small but perfectly adequate</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8 9 10'>The breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 10'>was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>better than the reviews</span> I had read of the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>It</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8 9'>was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8 9 10'>basic but entirely satisfactory</span> and the bread provided was fresh and not just the cheapest available. The one unfirtunate was that the toaster wasn;t working on our second day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>For the price paid</span> for a 2 night stay to visit the International Horse show at Olympia <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>it was excellent value for money</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Hey there, I booked a double room in January 2012 from booking.com and it cost me A44 for a Friday night. I booked this as I was moving home and needed a room for the night and this was one of the cheapest. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It was great value for money</span>. Bed was comfortable and clean, shower was great and there was a plasma tv with freeview in the room. Breakfast (toast,cereal & juice buffet style) was also included. The only negative I would say is that the room was slightly cold but I didn't ask them to turn on the heat so maybe this could of been remedied. I would recommend if you are looking for a nice budget hotel in a good location in London.</div><div class='text-box'>First of all, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the guy who works at the desk</span> during the day <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>is extremely rude and lazy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>They don't have an elevator</span>, and the guy just laughed at me when I asked if they had one. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>He didn't budge to help us carry our heavy luggage up three flights of stairs</span>. Then <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the room was tiny</span>, but that's not the biggest issue. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The bedspreads are dingy and dirty</span>. They look like they're from 1980. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>If I had to pick a pro</span> about this hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>it's in a nice area in Earl's Court and is very close to the tube</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>I wouldn't recommend staying here to anyone though.even an enemy</span>, ha.</div><div class='text-box'>Pros: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>Excellent location minutes away from Earls Court</span> tube <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>station</span>, plenty of restaurants around. Cheap and clean room, which is not that common in London. Cons: The staff at this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>hotel</span> is very rude except for the evening guy. There are no phones inside the rooms, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>no elevator</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you have to give a 20 pounds deposit to get a remote</span> (!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Also, staff won't bother checking if the room is ready if you arrive even a few minutes before check-in time (2pm).</span> Bottom line is don't expect any kind of service at this hotel (except from the evening guy) but then again, this is no 5 stars hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>We did book through booking.com as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>it was</span> in a very nice area and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>conveniently close to Earl's Court tube station</span>. As soon as we arrived, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>NOBODY came to us to help with luggage</span>. The place was dirty and stinky! The guy at the reception shown us our room; you know what? the room was even worse then the hotel itself! Walls were written on and dirty, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>bed linen were stained as well as the stinky carpet</span>. Immediately me and my wife shared the same thought: let's move out ASAP! Despite I would loose my already paid money, we decide to go somewhere else. Plese <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>do yourself a favor, run away from here</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>I wasn't sure what to expect having read some of the other reviews of this hotel. However I must say, my two night stay was rather pleasant. I had a double room which was extremely quiet and comfortable. The rooms are a little small and bijoux but cosy nonetheless. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff were polite</span> and helpful when we needed to leave our luggage before our room was ready. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would stay here again</span> as it's an excellent location for the Tube and sightseeing.</div><div class='text-box'>The other reviews have already said that the service is no existent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms</span> have been refreshed and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>are</span> clean but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>tiny</span>. Stay here if you only wish to sleep here. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Breakfast is an experience</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>everyone needs to breath in at the same time so you can get to the breakfast bar and around the tiny room</span>. Great location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Not sure this hotel is value for money</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Might be best to stay a bit further out</span> and get more for your A.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed here while visiting London. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Hotel was</span> reasonably priced and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very basic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are very small</span> as the hotel is built in an old townhouse. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8 9 10'>Breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>is provided</span> as part of the cost <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8 9 10'>is also basic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>On the whole reasonably cheap so what you get is not bad value</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">I will never stay again in this hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">this is Not a Value for Money hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The staff was rude.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">I had to carry my luggages several floors up from the (typical tiny) stairs ( no elevator in this hotel ).</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The room was Not for claustrophobic persons.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">there was also a small hole in the wall.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">and i had to figure out how to turn on the room heating !</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Last but not least i have to mention the poor Breakfast.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">this was not breakfast.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">it was something like breakfast.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">and really poor one.</span> <span id="11" class="summary-sentence">The only good part for this hotel is that was close to the Earls Cort Station.</span></div></div>
