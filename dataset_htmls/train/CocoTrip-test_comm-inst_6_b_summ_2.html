<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Other reviews already pointed out some of the unusual features of this hotel, which is located on the quiet water front close to the cruise ship terminal, an ideal location for an overnight stay before and after the cruise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was friendly & helpful</span>. Internet in the room was free and worked without any problem. The restaurant downstairs, with a good choice of wine by the glass, served tasty but pricey meals. However, there are several restaurants, grocery stores and deli shops in the neighbourhood frequented by the locals. One fish shop in the mall down the street, with a long queue at lunch hour, served a variety of seafood take-outs at reasonable prices, and the herring I tried that day was probably as good as it can be. For those who are health conscious, a morning stroll/jog along the water front would definitely help to kick off the day in the right mood.</div><div class='text-box'>Firstly the good thing about the hotel is cultural and clean, but it doesn't really feel much like a hotel, instead, a B&B. The overall service is just fair, we booked it in advance through zuji, but when we arrived, they had no record and we need to wait for an hour for checking in. In the first day out, we left the wallets inside a luggage which is locked. Of course it may be not wise to do it, but it was too late when we found 300 euro was gone when we back while everything seems fine in the appearance. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Probably</span> it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was stolen by the clean-up staff</span>. We were very disappointed with this hotel and would not recommend to travelers.</div><div class='text-box'>This is an unusual hotel, different from the normal run of the mill. I had a large and comfortable room, minimalist design which actually turned out to be quite relaxing! Its a few stops on the tram from the city, the road is reasonably quiet. The tram stop is close by, as is the canal hopper service. If you like design, or want to try something different then this might be for you.</div><div class='text-box'>I was there for 4 days. So all i have to say is that all we got were damaged walls and floors. the rooms are very manky. The toilets and showers were separately, but they were usually too dirty. The service often forget to finish their work. Only the location was good, there is a tram directly to the near Central Train Station</div><div class='text-box'>strengths: - nice old building with history (old prison) weaknesses: - too expensive (very bad price performance) 150 a for a two star room ! - bad tv reception - rooms looks like hospital/prison - old towels - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>lousy unfriendly service</span> - addtional extra fees: parking 22 a, touristfee 7 a, breakfast17 a - to far form the center - noisy</div><div class='text-box'>I did enjoy the stay, I will list the pros and the cons Pro -nice price -close to the trams <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>-helpful staff</span> -sweet to be able to order food in the middle of the night (it was possible in the hotel) -cool rooms cons -It was to far away from the city center to be able to walk.</div><div class='text-box'>The concept of having 1* to 5* rooms is great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Translation is another thing though because the service does not span that range</span>. Definitely quirky rooms but many have an open toilet, which is fine if you are single occupant. Restaurant not great.</div><div class='text-box'>I return from a weekend at the LLOYD hotel, it is a very good hotel, not useull, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>stuff are very freindly</span>, room very nice (2 stars) I would come back again and again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel are very helpful and friendly.</span></div></div>
