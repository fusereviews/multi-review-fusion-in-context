<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I recently stayed at the Park Place for three days with my wife and our 6 year old daughter. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel was clean</span> and well maintained. The service staff were pleasant and the front desk was helpful recommending attractions and providing directions. My daughter loved the pool and the access to the beach and boardwalk was very convenient. The room was on the top floor with an ocean <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>view.great view of the beach</span>, water and boardwalk, and surprisingly quiet with the balcony door shut. The hotel location is great.it is close to the amusements but not right on top of them.still right in the heart of the boardwalk with many nearby shops and restaurants. Overall, we were pleased with the hotel, the staff and the location.would definitely stay again!</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I went to Ocean City, MD for the first time this past week. We had looked on Trip Advisor and decided to book at Park Place hotel. We had a room on the bay side and we were very pleased. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was clean</span> and quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bed was comfortable</span>. The elevators were a bit slow, but we have been on slower. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We liked the location of the hotel on the boardwalk, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>especially enjoyed the deck that looked out over the boardwalk</span>. We enjoyed watching the fireworks on Tuesday night. We would definitely stay here again, and in fact, when we do go back, we will request an Ocean front room.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is a very good value on the boardwalk. We have two young daughters and the location proved to be excellent for proximity to rides and great food. The hotel was built in 2000 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the room was very clean and the</span> staff was very friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The efficiency part of the room is small</span> but provided much needed extra sink and they also include some silverware cups and bowls to use. I would suggest <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>an ocean front room</span> even though it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>is more expensive</span>, i think <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it is worth every penny</span>. The air conditioner in our room was a little loud but it worked excellent and kept us cool in the intense heat wave we were experiencing. Our family will definately stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the pph from 8/1-8/4, our room was a double oceanfront effic, and we had an <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>incredible view of the ocean</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>boardwalk</span>. I was really impressed with the housekeeping, they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>kept the room spotless</span>, even with my 2 kids dragging sand in from the beach, and loved the bath and body works products that were in the bathroom. I was VERY happy with pph, and am planning to book it again for 2009, only this time i would stay a couple more days.it was a little pricey, but definitley worth it, this was our 1st vacation in a few years. LOVED IT, and am very satisfied :)</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed two nights and it was an enjoyable hotel. The rooms were very quiet and quite comfortable. The bathroom was large, and clean. Loved the bath and body works shampoo and soap. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>pool was a bit small</span>. I would basically say it was a bit over average for most things. It was comfortable not spectacular. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Clean</span>. The TV large and was nice. The balcony was nice. It was a bit over-priced I would say. The pictures on the wall were a bit dull. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and that was a bonus. Off street parking was good also. I would stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here with our 2 small children, and we were very happy with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel</span>. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was clean</span>, and the kitchenette was perfect for us. The staff was excellent - we asked for an iron and had it in about 5 mins. We even asked about staying an extra night, and they were very accomodating about that. The location was perfect too. The only minus for us was trying to get the stroller out to the boardwalk we had to go through the restaurant. That was odd at times when it was crowded with people. We enjoyed ourselves and would stay again!</div><div class='text-box'>My family and I really enjoyed our week at this hotel! ( Aug 7-14) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The room was very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>spacious</span> enough for our family of 4. We had a ocean front room on the 6th - i would highly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>suggest paying a little extra for the view of the boardwalk and ocean</span>. Check in took 5 min. and the staff was helpful and friendly. The only con: Parking spaces are very tight!</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed on the sixth floor oceanfront room at the Park Place Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The view and location were perfect.</span> The off-season price was reasonable as well. The heated outdoor pool was great and being able to walk down the steps and be directly on the boardwalk and beach was terrific. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was clean</span> and comfortable as well. Overall an excellent experience at the Park Place Hotel.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The room was very clean and the hotel was clean also.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The couch in the room was not so comfortable.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The oceanfront patio was very nice, with an excellent view of the beach and the boardwalk.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The pool was standard hotel size and very clean.</span></div></div>
