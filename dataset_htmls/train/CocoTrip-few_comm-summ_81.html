<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My husband and i have been staying at The Talbott for nearly 20 years and we love it! The location can't be beat, of course, and the rooms are beautiful, especially the spacious marble baths. The fluffy down duvets are delightful too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The ever gracious staff is what sets The Talbott apart from the rest</span>. You will be warmly greeted at the door by the bellmen, then experience the same personal touch at the front desk and the concierge desk. People who are happy doing their job and personally connected to your excellent experience, that's the big deal. I am attaching a photo of Gene at the concierge desk, just one of the good friends you will also make at The Talbott hotel!</div><div class='text-box'>The Talbott is a great place to stay. It is a luxury boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, easily within walking distance of Michigan Avenue, State Street, and Navy Pier. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff is exceptionally friendly</span>. They provide twenty-four-hour room service, concierge service, and the front desk staff and waitstaff are even cheerful late at night. The rooms are modern, well decorated, and comfortable. They feature flat-screen sattelite televisions, ihome alarm clocks, and many other conveniences one would expect from a luxury hotel, without the sameness of the chains.</div><div class='text-box'>In a word - NOISY. A new hotel is being constructed out back. They start at 8 a.m. sharp and don't end until late at night. Every Day. I'd wait until it's done before staying there. If you only need one bed, they can move your room to the front of the hotel where it's not as bad. If you need more than one bed, though, you're out of luck. The hotel is nice, restaurant has very good food and otherwise the stay was fine.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed 5 nights at the Talbott which was in easy walking distance of the Hancock Tower, Millenium park, Sears Tower etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff were friendly, and helpful</span>. Menu was varied but limited. Numerous Restaurants nearby, avoid Gibsons as very expensive. We had large comfortable Room with walk in wardrobe, well equipped bathroom with his and hers toilet rolls and basins. Not cheap, but central and not as expensive as the Water Tower next door.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. The room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. Linens and towels first-class. Free Wi-Fi in the room. The location is terrific, just one block to Michigan Avenue. We will stay here on future visits.</div><div class='text-box'>We were advised by a friend about this hotel. We were travelling with a nother couple. old friends, and we were delighted with this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were extremely</span> courteous and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly</span>, the rooms were excellent, and the service efficient. It is a great location, and we would recommend it to our friends.</div><div class='text-box'>Much more than we expected, this hotel is gracious in every way. Suites are large, well appointed, with fabulous bathrooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff, including the front desk, and the concierge were so helpful</span>. A lovely, quiet and accomodating hotel, one of the very best! The Parkers</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Extremely helpful staff</span>, very convenient location, spacious and well appointed room. We surely would stay here again.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel are amiable and helpful.</span></div></div>
