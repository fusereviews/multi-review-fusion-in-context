<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>As a regular business traveller</span> to Singapore <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I always look forward to staying</span> at the Shangri-La. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great service, attention to detail and the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>ever present taxi-hailer</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>- make it feel like coming home.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>are spacious and comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with</span> quiet aircon and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>welcoming tea and fruit</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Room service is of a good standard</span> and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Shangri la is up there amoungst the</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>best</span>, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word "calm" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>touches like the changing of the carpet</span> in the lift <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>showing the day of the week</span>, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.</div><div class='text-box'>All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the free afternoon tea, canapes</span> and drinks go some way to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>mitigating against the high cost</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The eggs benedict for</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>breakfast was the best I've had</span> and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It isn't as centrally located as some hotels</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes</span> in a taxi if it means you can stay at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>such a wonderful hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>In the Lobby</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>all</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> you will get a glass</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi</span>. Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 10'>pool-site are very relaxing</span>, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne. Thanks a lot, Achem!</div><div class='text-box'>Spent 2 nights at this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fabulous hotel</span> during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rooms are large</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>standard of cleanlines is very high</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area</span>, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Buffet breakfast was great</span>, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>a huge choice and fresh products</span>. As my departure flight was at 11pm, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club</span>, with towels etc provided for shower. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cannot praise it highly enough</span>, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>free champagne</span> (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>spacious and luxurious</span> and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Fantastic hotel</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>wonderful rooms</span>, great beds, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>fruit in the room every day</span>, extensive gym.could not have asked for more. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>A few minutes walk from Orchard Road</span> so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close but far enough away to not hear the noise</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 10'>The gym</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and LINE restaurant</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 10'>were WONDERFUL</span>. I will definitely stay here again - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>perfect for my business trips to Singapore</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>What a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>wonderful atmosphere and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>a great room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>for a great price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast buffet was out of this world</span>. The room was gorgeous. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Service was exceptional</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a great hotel with extras not usually found in Singapore and is perfect for business or pleasure.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel isn't centralized to the city are others but is within walking distance of the shopping area and only a short taxi ride away from other areas of interest.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Excellent rooms that are spacious and luxurious, and for a great price.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The cleanliness is very good and they provide amenities, as well as welcoming tea and fruit, in all rooms.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The taxi-hailer was a nice touch.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Champagne in the lobby while you wait!</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">And the buffet breakfast was brilliant.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There is a huge choice and fresh food with rave reviews for the Eggs Benedict.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There is also free afternoon tea and canapes on offer.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">There are nice touches here at the hotel such as a changing carpet to reflect the day of the week in the hotel or the great WiFi connection that was free throughout the whole hotel.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">It even has a gym and swimming pool for guests to enjoy.</span></div></div>
