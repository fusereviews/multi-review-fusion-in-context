<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I read many negative reviews after I made a non-refundable reservation for two nights. SO.I took all the negative comments to heart and when I checked in, I specifically asked for a refurbished, quiet room. Supposedly there are some rooms with antiquated furniture and lots of noise, I waited a few hours to check in, but the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was</span> very nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>small</span>, but nice flat screen tv, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>modern furniture</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable king-size bed</span> and no noise even though we were near the elevator. I also got a coupon for free appetizer and $50 food and beverage credit. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything in the hotel is expensive</span> and Canada has a ton of tax on everything but the food was good and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the place is gorgeous</span> but be aware, parking was $42 a night. Absurd.</div><div class='text-box'>This review is a little late I know, however we have beeen constantly travelling since our stay in early Sept. I note all the other reviews regarding dated property and poor hotel standards and I also note the constant apologies from Hotel Management, however with so many poor reviews why don't they fix the problems, then they wouldn't have to keep apologing. I won't repeat all the comments from so many poor reviews other than so say, that was our experience as well. For the price, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>poor hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>poor value for money</span>, there are better options in Toronto.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at Royal York for 3 nights at start of a trans Canada tour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The lobby etc. of the hotel are very grand</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and imposing</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>well worth seeing</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was the smallest one of any of the hotels we stayed at</span> during trip, although it had the normal two large beds, there was not a lot of room around them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Dark furniture and small window did not add to the rooms appearance</span>. Having said this we enjoyed our time here but if we ever return to Toronto will try somewhere else.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed one night because of the hotel's convenient Porter Airline shuttle available outside the hotel's door. Staff was attentive and helpful, however the lines for the Concierge were long. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Lovely restaurants in the hotel</span> and there is an underground mall under the hotel. The hotel is a little expensive and parking is very expensive but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>the location is terrific</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are small but comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Hotel is large</span> and hallways are very long. Only complaint, typical of expensive hotels, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>you must pay $16 for internet access</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Located in heart of downtown near financial district and train station</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Historic hotel with grand lobby and lots of atmosphere</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms small</span> but clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable</span>. Service good, excellent concierge. Can be pricey, try to get a deal online, worth about 150 to 250 per night depending on time of year and size of room you get.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel on 9th Aug for three nights.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is superbly located in the tourist area of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived</span> in the hotel.We stayed on the gold floor with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast included</span> this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was outstanding</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we would highly recommend this</span> hotel for a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>truly fantastic first class hotel</span> in Torronto.</div><div class='text-box'>An <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>upgrade to an enormous suite</span>, fresh fruit and workout clothes waiting for me, 5pm check out, free shuttle to city airport. Very Royal indeed!</div><div class='text-box'>The service was impecabble! But the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The rooms are very small</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and DIRTY</span>. You can see dust everywhere!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Beautiful historic hotel well worth visiting.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It's of a large size with a grand lobby and there is a very charming atmosphere about the building.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This location is great for all the best tourist hot-spots and sight-seeing in the city.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were small and dark with dark furniture but the bed was comfortable and the furniture was modern.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The restaurants in general are brilliant and the breakfast served is an excellent quality.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Internet access is $16 from the hotel.</span></div></div>
