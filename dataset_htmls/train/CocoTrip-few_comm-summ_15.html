<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Okay after all the rave reviews of other guests I was expecting amazing. Guaranteed we had the crapiest weather over the NYE period, but we had paid for a package deal and half of what we paid for we never saw, they took some money off the final bill but even still what was outlined in our package was not included. The staff were aloof; one gentleman behind the counter was very approachable however the rest were rather aloof. The room was probably the smallest we had stayed in ad had a slanting roof which proved extremely difficult to move around as you were continually hunched over. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were not overly interested in what you did and in informing you of anything to do or see</span>, which was quite disappointing after the fantastic experiences we had had in Rome and Florence. Maybe this is the service you receive when you go to Flashy hotels and if this is the case then I am happily never going to a fancy hotel again - midrange hotels for me (better value for money)</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I returned to this superbly placed hotel for a wonderful four day break. (100 metres from St Marco). Right from the start, whilst making my reservation by phone, Jacopo made me feel welcome, and this wonderful service contiued throughout our stay. The resturant for breakfast is right on the lagoon and to sit outside in the sunshine and start your day with a plentiful multi choice breakfast is a pure joy. This lovely Hotel helped make our trip to this very special city all the more enjoyable. Our room was not large but perfectly equipped. A Lagoon view would have made it even better (maybe next time) I am sure there will be a next time, and definately at Savoia and Jolanda.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights in January 2004 as part of our honeymoon and we loved it. We did request a balcony room as recommended on trip advisor. It was beautiful a perfect view of the grand canal. It s location was perfect three doors away from the bridge of Sighs and 200 m from St. Marks Square. The room was plush , exposed beams, tastefully decorated but a bit disappointed that there was no bath in the bathroom. and room (or suite as it was called) was small by suite standards.1 room.(Bed with a couch and table) I would highly recommend it if you wanted to splash out for a special occassion it is a bit pricey.</div><div class='text-box'>In the middle of everthing. St. Marks, Museums, anf fine restarants. I really believe I could spend the rest of my life in this most beautiful city. The hotel and staff are magnificent. We have stayed there on two separate trips now and look forward to the third soon. My wife just loves to get lost waling the canals and alleways. Wonderful breakfast at the hotel as well. Steps away fro the San Zaccaria vaparetto stop.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is very conveniently located from the San Marco stop and faces the Grand Canal. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were not necessarily friendly, but they were not rude either. They were helpful</span> in giving us information and directions as well as storing our luggage after checkout so we could explore a bit before our scheduled time of departure. We were pleasantly surprised when we returned after dinner to find turn down service and chocolates on our pillows :-)</div><div class='text-box'>what a beautiful place looking out onto the St giorgio magiore church island. The rooms with views are quite expensive.but venice is a precious place with very little space. the restaurant is good (especially the free breakfast).but explore the many small trattorias, restaurants, and pannini bars.for much better though. the best value compared to cipriani, hilton danelli etc.would highly recommend</div><div class='text-box'>Definately the best bed i've slept during our vacation, rooms immaculates, wide choice at the restaurant for breakfast(homemade cakes!). More then central position facing the san marco basin.5 stars!</div><div class='text-box'>The location was great and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>employees were very helpful</span>.My ronn did not have a great view but it was very beautifuly decorated.I was on the second floor facing an alley.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful.</span></div></div>
