<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed 3 nights at the San Giusto at the end of our month long sojourn in Italy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It wasn't the worst of the hotels we stayed</span> in (not by far) but it wasn't the best either. The front desk staff was dismal, not rude but not personable either. The rooms were tiny but clean. We had problems with the electricity going off and got rather used to showering and eating in the dark, romantic no! Although the hotel is not centrally located it is easy to find and close to the metro. There are several resturaunts within walking distance with good food at reasonable prices. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfasts were fresh</span> and the service excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Although there is an elevator it is only accessable after you climb a flight of stairs</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>It was the fault of my life selecting San Giusto Hotel</span>. It was a central hotel but that is all. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The elevator is not in the entrance you have to climb long stairs to reach it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room is</span> very small, every door in the room includes the door of the wardrobe does not function well and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>noisy</span>. The bath was terrific; toilet siphon was out of function, the shower handle was broken, not mounted on the wall, it was on the floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We warned the staff about the problems, nothing has changed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast includes nothing, it is disgusting</span>. While we were leaving the hotel, they demonstrated their real attitude to their clients, behaved very agressive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I recommend any hotel in Rome but not San Giusto</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Firstly the bad thing the directions we were given were not good, so once off the metro it was more difficult to find than we were led to believe, but this was only because the main entrance does not face the Piazza Bologna. Look for the Pizzeria Caffee and it is next door. (But I wouldnt recommend using the Pizzeria Caffee). The hotel was lovely and clean, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. It is ideally located next to the Metro so sore feet on the way home dont have far to go. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast wasnt brilliant</span> and we were not given any information on times etc, but for a quick snack in the morning before setting off it was fine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>There is no way this is a 3 star hotel. There wasn't even tissue or soap. The rooms are very tiny of course, the AC is ancient but did work. There are no plugs, they're so ancient you can't use them. Rotary dial phone, you can't use. The staff was friendly enough but not helpful or able to put through a phone call. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>I would not stay here again</span>, the room was not dirty but it could have been a lot cleaner. On the last night we switched to a hotel called Imperio located next to Termini station which is better and less expensive. We paid 75 euro per night there but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>San Giusto was about 125euro - RIP OFF</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the hotel from 23rd to 26th June We found and excellent deal trough leonardihotels.com, 80/night double room (king size bed,clean and with airco), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>including a very good breakfast</span>. It's true that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>you have to carry your luggage up to 1st floor</span> but this was not a problem for us with light bags. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>Location is in a quiet area 30 minutes walking from Termini Station</span> but there is a Metro and Bus Stop around the corner., actually the best way to move around Rome it is by bus(very cheap ;-) ), bus line 62 at the corner will take you to Fontana di Trevi in about 12 minutes, .The Only inconvenient is that bus service finishes at 24:00h</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hotel San Giusto this September. The Hotel is basic, clean and perfect for doing Rome on a budget. The staff are exceptionally friendly, even putting up with my terrible Italian! Its close to a Metro Station which is a really convenient and cheap way to travel around the city. (Weekly unlimited ticket is only 16 euro) There is also a fantastic restaurant just around the corner, and plenty of shops in the area. The rooms are a little on the small side, but very well kept and air conditioned. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>would recommend</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>this</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>hotel without hesitation</span>, first class as long as you know what your getting.</div><div class='text-box'>We found a good price through lastminute.com, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the location was excellent</span> for access by public transport (the hotel is right at a Metro station, and on bus lines from major sites including the Vatican). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The room was well-fitted out</span>. However, we found that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>the shower water never got hot</span>, and there was an icy draft in the bathroom (it was winter). Another drawback is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>you must carry your luggage up one flight, before getting to the lift</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast was ok but nothing special</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We recently visited Rome and spent 3 evenings at Hotel San Guisto. We travelled with our friends. We admit, their room had an unusual door that appeared very unsecure, however, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>overall, the rooms were clean, affordable and convenient</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was great</span>, as it was around the corner from the Bologna metro station (line B), and also is at the end of bus line 62 (useful info, as metro line A closes at 9:30pm). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We would consider staying here again</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This was not a good experience!</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The beds were uncomfortable but the bathroom was clean.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The room was at the front of the hotel which was soo noisy (even throughout the night).</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The lift only goes from the 1st floor so a struggle to get luggage to the room and you still have to navigate stairs all the way.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Breakfast was poor.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">I would not recommend this as it certainly wasn't a budget hotel!</span></div></div>
