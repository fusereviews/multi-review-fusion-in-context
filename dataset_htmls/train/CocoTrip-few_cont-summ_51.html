<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Olimpia over the new year holiday for four nights. It is everything it claims to be and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>it looks just like the photos on the website</span>. The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room staff was great too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Hotel is located about a minutes walk from the vaporetto station</span>. You should buy an extended vaporetto pass if you are going to be in town for a stretch of time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The railway station was a short three minute walk away</span>, and St. Mark's Square took about 1 hour at a leisurely pace to reach.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel is quietly situated</span>, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>well located for the trains, buses and vaporetto</span>. It is very clean and comfortable with friendly and efficient staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Excellent selection for breakfast</span>. I developed a health problem whilst in Venice and the reception staff could not have been more helpful and supportive in assisting me to resolve the matter. I would certainly stay at this hotel if we return to Venice. Our only criticism would be that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the room was a little on the small side</span> but as we spent a great deal of time sightseeing it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay.</div><div class='text-box'>If you are cruising, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this a great location. We walked</span> from cruise terminal to Piaza Roma. The hotel is visible from the Piaza. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>You can get</span> to the airport by <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>bus</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>cab</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>or water taxi practically from the front door</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was small</span> but had a nice view. We left the window and shutters open and it still was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>not too noisy</span>, although there is activity going on almost all night. Small but usable elevator, which you don't always get. The location and ease of travel made it worth the price.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel was very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was</span> quite beautiful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very large by Venice standards</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>a canal view</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>good breakfast</span>. The only complaint is that it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>near the end of a vaparato route</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> and too far to walk at night from San Marco</span> (unless you are actually familiar with the streets and alleys of Venice.) The restaurant, Brucinellis, in the same building was not so great. The bass was very disappointing, and I believe they refill the water bottles with tap water.</div><div class='text-box'>A 3 euro ticket from the airport takes you to Plaza da Roma in 15 mins, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you can see the hotel as you get off the bus</span>, A 2 minute walk up steps along small bridge and down steps brings you to Hotel Olimpia. We arrived at Marco Polo at 9p.m by 10p.m we had checked in and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>were eating supper overlooking canal by hotel-magical</span>.Rooms very pretty, not big, but comfortable.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Breakfast plentiful</span>. Very convenient for leaving luggage there when checking out.Would definetly stay there again, not cheap though.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a good hotel, cold air conditioning, warm and friendly staff, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>only two bridges from train station and one bridge from Water busses</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and Piazzaie Roma</span>. They have tables with an awning outside their front door so you can sit and have some wine and enjoy Venice. A good restaurant is right next door and the staff will tell which ones in the area to avoid.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights prior to our cruise, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>hotel is very conveniently located transportation wise</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>from the airport and pier</span>. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and friendly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and the breakfast was very good</span>. The only note is that the shower was actually smaller than the one on the ship. Great hotel, I would stay there again and recommend it to friends.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Located close to bus station need to take 2 bridges to get here from the train station</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything is close by</span> in venice, front-desk person was super nice and very talkative. Have to climb 4 floors to go our room, luckily the doorman helped us with the luggages. Stayed here one night and they stored our luggage for free.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is really well-placed in a quiet spot however only a few minutes' walk away</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">you can access public transportation and go further afield if desired.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The size of the rooms in the hotel differ but do have a canal view.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast food here was plentiful and you can choose to eat your supper overlooking the canal to provide a magical experience.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel looks exactly as advertised on their website and the checking out process was very efficient.</span></div></div>
