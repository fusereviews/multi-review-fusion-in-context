<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the XV Beacon recently and from the minute we got out of our car (valet right at the entrance) to the minute we left the service/staff was exceptional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were beautiful</span> and very clean and much larger than we expected from a historical building. There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston</span> next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life. We would definitely go back to this hotel, combined with the location we had a great experience!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this hotel while traveling on business and it was by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The second I walked in the room, I knew that I wasn't going to want to leave and ordered myself some room service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It has a very classic style with every modern convenience</span> you could hope for. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bed is very comfortable and the fireplace makes it very cozy</span>. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The shower was also fantastic</span>. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it if you can swing it!</div><div class='text-box'>My boyfriend has stayed here several times for business trips but this was our first leisure visit-service remains impeccable. Still received his personalized business cards and professional attentive service. Rooftop is a nice touch on a warn day to share a bottle of wine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Hotel car service was a great perk</span> as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town. I am a huge product snob-the Lemon Sugar line from Fresh that they provide in the rooms has made me a regular user. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>And the location is perfect</span>-within walking distance to everywhere. When it's colder out, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we will return and use the fireplace in our beautiful room</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Labor Day weekend, the same number of nights as we stayed in October 2007. An elegant, small hotel! The front desk and room service staffs, the concierges, restaurant and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>in-room breakfasts</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the chauffeured car service</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>all</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Our room (#407) was very elegant and quiet</span>, was on the west side of the building, and had windows on 2 walls. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Our only problem was that the sink taps were very tight</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were on a business/leisure trip. It was a high star rating and deserved it. Around the corner from Boston Common, Fanueiul Hall, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Easy to get to city centre</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel breakfast was fantastic</span>, if expensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Every dish was amazing.</span> When in Boston city, the Mapparium is worth a visit, along with the top of the Prudential building, to get a great idea of where everything is. There are some great museums to visit.</div><div class='text-box'>as local residents and first time guests, we found this hotel exceeded our expectations. staff were nothing but attentive and hospitable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>our room was upgraded</span> upon arrival; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we couldn't have asked for more</span>. this is a lovely hotel with not only luxurious amenities but superb staff. we can't wait to return!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed a few weeks ago at this hotel and I heard everything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The walls are thin as paper</span> as i heard every conversation from the room next door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I apprectiate that some builings in boston are older, but if you own a hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>you must do something ot soudnproof it</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Favourite hotel in Boston. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Modern luxury without seeming formulaic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Good for</span> indulgent <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>weekends in town</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has all the modern conveniences but is set out in a classical style.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It's super easy to access the city centre from this hotel, making it a great hotel for location.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">At this hotel some rooms are very elegant and quiet with comfortable beds and even a fireplace.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The shower was great, too, but the walls are really thin.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel even provides car service.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provided some great food and every dish tasted great.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Unfortunately the taps on the sinks were pretty tight and because it is an older building there seemed to be no soundproofing.</span></div></div>
