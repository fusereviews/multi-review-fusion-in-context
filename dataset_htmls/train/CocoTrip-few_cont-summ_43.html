<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed here during Mardi Gras and couldnt ask for a better location. St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in</span>. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room is equipped with a small kitchen</span> which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it's a good base to explore New Orleans with the trolley right outside your door</span>. It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter.probably 30 minutes to 40 minutes. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms could be updated, but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 6'>staff was very helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>even during the stressful Mardi Gras time (super busy for them</span>) It also had a very spacious and updated gym to burn those calories off from all the good food you eat in New Orleans</div><div class='text-box'>From the time we stepped out of our car to hand over our keys to the time we left <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>we were treated like royalty</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The porters,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and made us feel most welcome</span> especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>a studio with a</span> king bed and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>full kitchen</span>, dressing area and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>shower</span>. All were very clean. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The Resort is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in a residential area</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>right on the St. Charles trolley line</span>. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>purchased a Jazzy Pass</span> at Walgreens down the street <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and never needed our car</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My daughter and I spend a weekend here while job hunting, school interviewing and house hunting. This was the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>perfect home base for all of our explorations</span>. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying outside of the Quarter. It was wonderful! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>The staff was amazing, so very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>spacious</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>well appointed</span>, the beds very comfortable and everything upgraded and modern. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy</span>. Would recommend this to anyone <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>visiting this amazing city</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>WOW - looking via the internet I was looking forward to staying at the Avenue Plaza. Too bad there was no information about them being timeshares. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The location is great - right on the St. Charles streetcar line</span>. But <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>we didn't get fresh towels, the beds were not made up, the floors were dirty</span>.NOT what you want to see when you are traveling, especially when you know <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>there are so many hotels in NO that are way classier</span>. Would not recommend staying here at all.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The staff was very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bathroom was small</span>, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location for bar/ restaurant hopping on St Charles</span>, nice and clean pool, fantastic steak house on site! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Fun 24/7 bar next door for karaoke</span>. Loved my stay for my birthday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Walk down to the Blind Pelican for drinks</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>15$ taxi to quarter</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>great shopping on Magazine st.</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Staff were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>friendly</span> and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms were large</span> and clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>well appointed with tv, kitchenette, etc</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Great shower</span>. Even though this is a timeshare there was no pressure to buy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>All staff went out of there way to be helpful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>wonderful place to stay in a beautiful section of New Orleans</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Fine dining</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>transportation</span> all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>within walking distance</span>.
