<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I booked the Ocean Mecca after doing extensve research on-line about accommodations in OC, it was our first time in OC and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I'm very glad we stayed at the Ocean Mecca</span>! Compared to other hovels on the board walk we breathed a huge sigh of relief. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's in a nice quiet location on the boardwalk</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>an awesome pool</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were SPOTLESS and kept very clean every day by the super friendly staff</span>. It was good value, not super cheap but I was happy to pay the price for the cleanliness, we have a baby and a 4 year old. My son is still talking about it and we are going back next year!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>My family & I stayed for 4 days and were very pleased with everything</span>. The bathroom seemed recently renovated & was spotless! I loved this. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The pool</span> & view from the 2nd floor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was fantastic</span>. The housekeeping was excellent & friendly - kept the sand swept up & had plenty of clean towels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The front desk was very friendly & helpful</span>. Plenty of parking & the balcony was very nice & clean. Room was a little small for 4 of us - maybe we need to rent a bigger room - could of used a little more storage - but would stay here again in a heartbeat.</div><div class='text-box'>We chose Ocean Mecca as our motel due to the great price and for the fact that it was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3 6'>right on the beach</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6'>and boardwalk</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The only thing I didn't like about the location was that</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>we were further down on the boardwalk</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>than I thought</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Most of the restaurants and other attractions are down further so we did quite a bit of walking</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room is</span> small but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>always kept clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the people at the desk were very nice</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the pool area was great</span> too! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>I'd most likely stay again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This place is no frills but very clean, well-maintained, great rates for oceanfront hotel. The pool was clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Literally right on the boardwalk</span> so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>you could sit on the pool deck and look at the ocean and beach</span>. Young dark haired gal at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful and so was the Irish student working for the summer. These kids did a great job and we appreciated their advise. I would stay here again! ( this is a two story small hotel but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location was great</span>)</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Ocean Mecca is a great place to stay</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were impeccably clean</span> and the maids kept them clean daily. The bathrooms were very clean as well and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staff friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The pool was nice and clean too</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is walking distance to the</span> beach and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>boardwalk</span>. The only one complaint I have is that the air conditioner in the room was a bit loud. Other than that, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I recommend this place</span>, two thumbs up!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Our stay at the Ocean Mecca Motel was very pleasing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is the best for all reasons</span>. Plenty of parking, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>right on the boardwalk</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>great pool</span> on boardwalk, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>walking distance to anything</span>. I will definitely go back when I can. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are clean</span> and reasonable. I only wish they had coffee in the rooms or in the office. But I guess I can use the exercise.</div><div class='text-box'>Just returned from OC over the 4th of July. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Our stay at Ocean Mecca was wonderful</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>rooms are</span> basic, but very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>. The office <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>staff was very nice</span> and the maid service was exceptional. There <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>is a large pool</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>on the boardwalk</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with a sundeck</span> and the motel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>has a great location</span>.
