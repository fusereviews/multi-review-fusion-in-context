<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms are clean and spacious, and furnished</span> with nice pieces that truly demonstrate their concern with quality. The only problem is that the beach is not really a beach, but a 30 feet stretch of sand where they park a couple of dirty kayaks and 2 or three jet skis . The water looks dirty and it filled with seaweed. The rest of the waterfront is not for swming as there is 5 feet concrete wall drop . I even saw what I think its a grey water discharge pipe . Bottom line is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>if you want a nice comfortable hotel and don't care about the private beach, this is for you</span> . If you are looking to get wet in the blue waters of key west while in hotel grounds, look for other options. Also parking is $18 . They will not tell you . You will see it in your credit card later.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Awesome rooms,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>made me feel right at home</span>, Make sure you get a poolside or beach facing room the others just dont make the cut, we were first checked into what I would call a closet for $190 a night, which is still quite expensive, and we upgraded to a poolside for $50 more and it was well worth it, Just absolutely adored the room, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had a kitchen, the best bathroom and a balcony view</span> of the pool, Only flipside like other travellers say there is no real beach and you cant swim its just a stretch of sand to sun yourself so dont be fooled by the beach! Key West has a lot of water activities so we didnt really miss the beach!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this Marriott for our wedding. We stayed three nights. It was amazing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel room was beautiful. Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>marble floor, jetted tubs, walk in shower, etc.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I really enjoyed our stay</span>. The hotel is not in the heart of Key West, but they offer a free shuttle service to downtown every 30 minutes and return shuttle every 20 minutes after the hour. The staff was nice, our room was clean and the decor was great. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>would highly recommend staying there</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Had a great weekend stay at the marriott in Key west. The rooms are fantastic. Two bedroom suite was wonderful. The staff was very accomodating, and they offer free transportation form the hotel every hour to downtown key west. the bus drops you right off at margaritaville, The hotel pool and bar was very spacious, and they have a small sand beach also. The hotel restaurant was jammed saturday night, and it is 5 minutes from the airport. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>higly recommedn</span> this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Key West and stayed here using Marriott points. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Room was stunning</span>. Waterfront view, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>2 balconies, huge living room/dining room/kitchen</span>. 1 1/2 baths-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>jacuzzi tub and spacious stand up shower</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Shuttle service to Duval was nice</span> but would have been nicer to have been within walking distance. Shuttle back to hotel at night was full of rowdy drinkers. Received breakfast passes since I'm a Rewards member-it only included fruit/bread area-not even the usual Marriott powdered eggs-that section was $4 extra per person.</div><div class='text-box'>We were all set to go and just the night before came under the weather with flu and had to cancel the booking. Normally the hotel charges $150 as a penalty but upon learning about our situation the hotel management happily agreed to waive the penalty. This was the week after Thanksgiving, so it was not as if they were heavily booked and would find last minute reservations. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Very few times have I seen such a courteous hotel management</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This is a wonderful property</span> located right as you enter the island. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful and the pool and poolbar are a blast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Rooms are very nice and comfortable</span>, and the staff is great. Definitely a great option for your trip to Key West!</div><div class='text-box'>We've stayed here two times in the past 3 years. I've got to say that the accomodations are still excellent and service from the staff is outstanding!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are nicely furnished and spacious.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Highly recommended for stays, weddings, or last-minute bookings</span></div></div>
