<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>After the ride from hell from the airport and then to be ripped off by the cabbie just for the fun of it, he over charged us by 25 Euro's total charge for a near death experience was 80 Euro's. So first impressions of Rome were to say the least not very good. Finally arrived at the hotel the surrounding areas were not very nice. The actual hotel was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>in need of a lot of repair</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Very dated and old fashioned</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The actual rooms were very depressing</span>. The balcony wasn't much better falling apart <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with wires hanging out of the wall</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff not very helpful at all</span>. Would not recommend this hotel. Did enjoy my time in Rome but it could of been a lot better.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for the final night of an Insight tour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The room they gave us smelt of smoke and was right beside the huge air conditioning fans</span>. They told us to open our windows to get rid of the smell but when you did that you couldn't hear anything because of the noise from the fans. The front desk staff were extremely unhelpful and clueless. The breakfast was one of the worst we experienced in a hotel in Italy. The noise in the street below was horrendous with lots of screaming during the night. I didn't feel safe even with my door locked. On a good note though there was an amazing gelato shop just across the road that we enjoyed spending time in.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is NOT a 4 stars hotel</span>! The clerk were very rude, the breakfast waitress was loud and very unprofessional. We paid a discounted price and can't really complain, but it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>ddid nopt look like a 4 stars hotel</span>. The room was clean and tidy, I'll give you that, but on our second day we found towels around the room and a cloth they used for cleaning on a chair. The bathroom was not that nice, no jacuzzi and the toilet seat was moving. I've been in many 3 stars better than this, don't waist your money, Rome has SO MUCH to offer!</div><div class='text-box'>the hotel room did not look like the pictures,i was disappointed and scared.it was pocky and dark could not unpack only 4 hangers.double <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>bed was 2 singles put together.the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>heater was broken and cracked</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it should of been condemed,DANGEROUS.The rattle of the shutter kept us awake.it</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>should not have 4 stars.the</span> room was clean.the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms should have 2 stars</span>,we were on the 7th floor ,maybe the rooms below were better?the lift was a little old,the rest of hotel was nice the breakfast was great.the bar was not open.we made the best loved rome.i would not stay again i would do my homework better next time.</div><div class='text-box'>Fiasco trying to book the hotel online (they don't own their own website?). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>My room had clearly once been broken into: the door hinge area was all chewed up</span>. Breakfast was a disaster, the coffee is the worst I have ever tasted, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>not what I expect from</span> an Italian <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>hotel</span>. The bar staff was slow and rude The other reviews about the key cards not working are absolutely right, the system fails every so often and I could have easily got a key card for another room because they didn't bother to check my ID or name. Summary: shockingly bad. Steer clear.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here with a school group for a couple of nights, and compared to other hotels I've stayed at in Rome, this one was fine. The bathroom was spacious enough, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>room was typical</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in size</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>for four-star hotels</span> in Rome. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>air-conditioning worked well</span> and stayed on all night. The food in the restaurant was good, and the staff was quick and courteous. Just around the corner is the Euclide station (undergroun) for the Roma-Viterbo train, so we were just one stop from the Flaminio station of Metro Line A.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in this hotel prior to going on a Med cruise, and was apprehensive as the location was quite a distance from the city centre. However the train station is just around the corner and getting into Central Rome was easy. The area surrounding the hotel is upper class residential and very safe for walking, even in the evening. The staff were very helpful with local information and I was given a large suite on the top floor. The breakfast was continental and the coffee was good. I would recommend this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel is very "old</span>". Its like it comes from the sixties or seventees, without any renovation. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The rooms are full of wall papers and old "tired" textiles</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 5'>The curtain in the bathroom was rivened</span>. The breakfast was poor and the quality bad. Just 3-4 choices. For this hotel we spend 245 euro for a triple room.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The Lobby</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">it's nice but the rooms are terrible</span><span id="2" class="summary-sentence">, this is not what you expect from a 4 stars hotel!</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">My bed was very, very small.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The heating control was broken, the lights decided to turn on twice during the night by itself.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Bathroom smelly and very old.</span></div></div>
