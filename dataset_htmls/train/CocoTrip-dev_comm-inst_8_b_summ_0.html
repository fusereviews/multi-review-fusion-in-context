<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>The Orto de' Medici Hotel, Florence This medium-priced Hotel offers a very good price to service ratio. The rooms are very clean and being an old but refurbished building, it has high and well appointed rooms.The hotel offers - as a garni hotel - an excellent breakfast (self-service from two tables). Being not on a thoroughfare, it is quiet at night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Its situation in relation to the main attraction,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the Piazza del Duomo, is a seven to ten minute's walk</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity</span>, especially just opposite is the restaurant Il Cardellino. At the reception English and French is spoken. The service personnel is very friendly and is supervised by the proprietor himself.The Hopp on / Hopp-off Bus can be taken from the Piazza San Marco, approximately 200 meters from the hotel Orto de' Medici, where also other regular bus lines part for the hinterland.</div><div class='text-box'>A room with a view What a great place! Just returned from 4 nights here and delighted with the choice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Central location - only a few minutes walk from the Accademia</span>, but tucked away in a side street so as quiet as it can be in Florence (or any major city for that matter!). Ask for room 45, on the 4th floor (don't panic there is a lift), if you want a room with a balcony and a view over the roof tops to the Duomo and Campanile. Continental breakfast was light but adequate, but hotel too small to serve dinner - not a problem with so many good restaurants to choose from! Go and enjoy!</div><div class='text-box'>Short walk from the Madding crowds of Firenze The website was accurate in its promises. The service to arrange for private pick-up from the train station to the airport was excellent as was the arranging for museum tickets. Contact to confirm reservations was propmpt. The rooms are simple, but clean and we slept well for five restful nights. The common room is very comfortable, as is the breakfast area. The patio serves dynomite gin tonics for happy hour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is a pleasant walk from the main downtown sights in a less touristy and more local scene</span>. Would definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>Good 3 star hotel in Florence Good 3-star <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>hotel in central</span> Florence, very close to the Accademia and to the Duomo. Lots of restaurants nearby. Room is fairly spacious but basic in decor and clean. Bedroom windows are double-paned, so that noise is not a problem. Bathroom could use a little updating but would speculate that it has been updated within last 10 years. Good American style stand-up shower. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, is well above average and in a lovely room which also has a very nice terrace. Friendly front desk.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Extremely friendly/helpful staff here</span>! The Orto De Medici was a wonderful hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>perfectly located in Florence</span>. The continental breakfast was grand and offered world travelers a diverse selection of foods and drinks.The hotel is superbly clean and beautifully decorated. The front desk staff was the best I've ever encountered. They were compassionate with our lost luggage situation and gladly booked us reservations for the Uffizi gallery.Although the walls are a bit thin in the room and it seemed a bit noisy at night.I would stay at this hotel a thousand times over.Thanks for a fabulous stay.</div><div class='text-box'>Wonderful We had a wonderful week's stay at this charming hotel. The service was first class, the room and bathroom were spacious and immaculately clean.The best part, however was the sun-lit , beautifully appointed breakfast room with, again, perfect service.We would definitely go back when we return to Florence.</div><div class='text-box'>Absolutely Lovely! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>A view from the Bell Tower</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>looking at the Duomo</span></div><div class='text-box'>My favorite Italian experience <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>In front of the Hotel Orto De Medici</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel are very helpful.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel is simply superb becaus</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">it's in a central location close to downtown sights and also more representative of locals.</span></div></div>
