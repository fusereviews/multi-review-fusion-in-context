<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I was lucky enough to be able to accompany my husband on a business trip to the Gaylord Palms Resort. We were thrilled from beginning to end. We pulled up to the magnificent resort and were delighted at the front desk with warm welcomes and friendly personalities from all. The front desk engaged us both in conversation and gave many tips on how I could enjoy the resort while my husband was working. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Our room in the Emeral Bay section of</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the hotel was very clean</span> and whenever we needed anything (toiletries, turn down service, directions) we dialed #88 on our room phone and were connected to friendly staff with all the answers! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I explored</span> resturants, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the spa</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the pools</span> and truly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>enjoyed my relaxing few days</span> at this resort. I recommended this hotel to couples, families, business travelers, and soloists.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved the hotel and the grounds. We got an incredible deal on hotwire, so we couldn't beat the value. The service was excellent. We were traveling with two small children and they were very accomodating. The only complaint was that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the food was very expensive</span>. We were not traveling on an expense account and we had failed to rent a car, so our dining options were limited to the Resort. A simple continental breakfast cost us over $8-too much to spend on a bowl of cereal and a banana for a two year old. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The restaurants were very expensive</span> and we wound up ordering in pizza one night. But if you're on an expense account or have a car to get to the store (each room has a refrigerator) or to other dining options, this is a fantastic place to stay.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at the gaylord Palms for the past couple of years for a yearly convention . I love this place and the friendly service we receive while there . I'm sure the prices are higher than other hotels , but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I feel we get what we pay for</span> . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I do think the boat could be a little better as far as the food</span> they serve . etc. . I look forward to this as a weekend spot every year for my convention and while I am only an hour away after the weekend we feel like we have had a mini vacation . I wouldn't change one thing about my stay except that I would love to be able to stay a week . I look forward to this years convention and the fun times my kids will have</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Most rooms overlook an interior, glass covered courtyard</span> which reminded me of the habitats you see at the zoo. If you are the spouse of a convention goer, you are trapped there. There is nothing to do but sit at the pool or work out if you don't want to go to Disney World. Even the chairs and benches are uncomfortable and designed to make you move on. I longed to find a window and look out at the real world.</div><div class='text-box'>The Shrek the Halls display was very cool (no pun intended). It's quite chilly, but very neat to see all the figures made of ice. The ICE attraction with the snow was very simple. Young children that have never seen snow would appreciate it,but that's about it. Our 9 year old was very bored. Thought the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>prices were quite expensive</span>. Plus it's $13 to park.ugh!</div><div class='text-box'>Our 1 bedroom suite was spectacular! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Large bedroom</span> and living room each with flat screen in HD. Wifi throughout the facility. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very clean resort</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Beautiful atriums with fish, alligators</span> etc. Daily feedings with question and answer periods. Many restaurants and bars located within. Only minutes from Disney. Golf nearby at Celebration with preferred rates when booked through the concierge. Nothing bad to say at all</div><div class='text-box'>Brought my mother to celebrate her b-day. Both restaurants where we dined were very good - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>cannot say enough great things about Old Hickory</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>steak was one of the best I've had</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>massage was terrific</span> and you must wear their most comfortable robe back to your room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Highly recommend this hotel</span> and would definitley stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>Visited the Gaylord Palms this past weekend and was definitely impressed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Rooms extremely clean</span>, staff very helpful, check-in was speedy, and activities to keep my son occupied for awhile. I definitely will be visiting again. Beautiful hotel, great staff and great location.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A few days isn't enough at this hotel because it's so relaxing, clean, and there is a spa and multiple pools to explore.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the Emerald Bay section of the hotel were very clean and all items were well stocked in the room.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The bedrooms are large too and some overlook a courtyard separated by a glass covered interior.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's food can be a little on the expensive side and the quality could have been greater.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had picturesque atriums with alligators, various fish and other species.</span></div></div>
