<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This was our fourth stay at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Le Hotel Clement</span>, and we will return. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location is perfect</span> for us, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the rooms are very</span> comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>, and cute with air conditioning ,and every room has a shower (hand-held) in the tub. There is very little help or recognition from the front desk, but they are willing to answer simple questions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There are many</span>, many good and inexpensive (for Paris) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>restaurants in the immediate area</span>, all within a short walking distance. Even th;e rooms facing the street are quiet, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it's not a heavily trafficked street</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are not large</span> but are more than adequate in size. We have stayed in many hotels <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in Paris</span>, but for price and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location the Hotel Le Clement can't be beat</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We highly recommend the Hotel Le Clement on Rue Clement, in the heart of Paris in the St. Germain Des Pres district. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We could not have asked for a better location</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>so close to all of the great restaurants and shops in the St. Germain Des Pres</span>. A short walk to the famous cafes: Cafe Flore, Le Deux Magots, etc. Plus, it's only one block south of Boulevard St, Germain and four blocks south of the River Seine and the Louvre. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The neighborhood is very safe</span> too. My wife and I spent our 10 day honeymoon here and were impressed at how friendly and dedicated the staff was. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our Room was clean</span> and had all of the comforts to make our stay very pleasant. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We would definitely stay at Hotel Le Clement again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location</span> in the heart of St. Germain, one block from Odean Metro on St. Germain Blvd. and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>surrounded by nice restaurants</span> and across the street from an upscale fruit and vegetable market. 2 blocks from great Rue Bucci and Rue du Seine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Had a triple which was very small</span>, as is typical. Recommend a room overlooking street. No locks on bathroom doors. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>My problem with hotel is that there was major construction on first floor.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>No breakfast room</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>dust, construction all day long</span>. They did not apologize for the inconvenience, and basically one just went right up to the room. Very disappointing. With that said, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>location is great</span> and desk was polite. Quaint but simple. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I would stay there again if there were no construction</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>had a lovely 3 days at the Le clement with my family with 3 teenagers. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>Our room was small but clean</span> and very quiet. The girls room was more spacious and lovely with a bath <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>but</span> they said <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>it was a little noisy at night</span> with the bar across the road. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The breakfast was great with plenty to eat</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>The location was great</span> as we had caught the Eurostar to paris and then took the metro to Mabbion which was a minutes walk from Le Clement. The staff were not overly helpful but that didnt really worry us too much. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I will return to le Clement next time</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at Le Clement two separate times on a recent trip to France, both at the beginning and the end of my stay in France. I found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>the rooms small</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>nicely furnished and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>very clean</span>. The staffis friendly and accomodating. If i had been traveling with my husband, I would have requested a larger room on the street, as the rooms on the courtyard at very small, but quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>For the price, this hotel is a tremendous value</span> in the 6th and retains much French character and charm. JH Maui, Hawaii</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Hotel Le Clement</span> was a very pleasant surprise! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our room</span> (Superior Double Room, 210) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>had a very good size</span>, the bathroom was great (even had a bathtub), not to mention the beautiful decor and the Paris style. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The breakfast was very nice and worth the price</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 6 7'>location is very good</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'> close to many</span> bars and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>restaurants</span>, two metro stations, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and several large stores</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The staff was not so receptive</span> and did not speak English very well, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>but did not cause any problems</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I recommend</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was great</span>! Metro was just one block down <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and made it easy to get all around Paris</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We loved the neighborhood</span> as well, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very lively at night</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>lots of restaurants</span> and cafes.The staff was friendly and helpful for any questions that we had. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>Our room was small as expected but very clean</span>. Our room faced the street and I didn't find a problem with noise after about 10pm. I thought this was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>a great find for the price and location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>and would stay here again</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>This hotel was in a perfect location</span>-but a little too lively in the early hours at times. The staff could not have been more helpful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 7'>the room was clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>and comfortable</span> and it was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>within easy walking distance of all major attractions</span> (and if not up to the walk, the nearest 'Metro' is only minutes away.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Hotel Le Clement is in a great location for sightseeing Paris.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The neighborhood is safe and busy all evening.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">We did not have breakfast at the hotel but found good places nearby.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were very small but clean.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The airconditioning was controlled by the front desk and managed to cool the room.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">If the price seems right I might stay here again for the location.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There was really nothing wrong with the hotel, but then nothing special about it either.</span></div></div>
