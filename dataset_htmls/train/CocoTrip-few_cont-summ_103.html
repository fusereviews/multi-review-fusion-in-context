<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the XV Beacon recently and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>from the minute we got out of our car (valet right at the entrance) to the minute we left the service/staff was exceptional</span>. The rooms were beautiful and very clean and much larger than we expected from a historical building. There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life. We would definitely go back to this hotel, combined with the location we had a great experience!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this hotel while traveling on business and it was by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The second I walked in the room, I knew that I wasn't going to want to leave</span> and ordered myself some room service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It has</span> a very classic style with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>every modern convenience you could hope for</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bed is very comfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the fireplace makes it very cozy</span>. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. The shower was also fantastic. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it</span> if you can swing it!</div><div class='text-box'>My boyfriend has stayed here several times for business trips but this was our first leisure visit-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>service remains</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>impeccable</span>. Still received his personalized business cards and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>professional attentive service</span>. Rooftop is a nice touch on a warn day to share a bottle of wine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Hotel car service was a great perk</span> as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town. I am a huge product snob-the Lemon Sugar line from Fresh that they provide in the rooms has made me a regular user. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>And the location is perfect-within walking distance to everywhere</span>. When it's colder out, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>we will return and use the fireplace in our beautiful room.</span></div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Labor Day weekend, the same number of nights as we stayed in October 2007. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>An elegant, small hotel!</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The front desk and room service staffs, the concierges, restaurant and in-room breakfasts, and the chauffeured car service were all excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room (#407) was very elegant</span> and quiet, was on the west side of the building, and had windows on 2 walls. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Our only problem was that the sink taps were very tight</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were on a business/leisure trip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was a high star rating and deserved it</span>. Around the corner from Boston Common, Fanueiul Hall, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Easy to get to city centre</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel breakfast was</span> fantastic, if <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>expensive</span>. Every dish was amazing. When in Boston city, the Mapparium is worth a visit, along with the top of the Prudential building, to get a great idea of where everything is. There are some great museums to visit.</div><div class='text-box'>as local residents and first time guests, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>we found this hotel exceeded our expectations</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff were nothing but attentive and hospitable</span>. our room was upgraded upon arrival; we couldn't have asked for more. this is a lovely hotel with not only luxurious amenities but superb staff. we can't wait to return!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed a few weeks ago at this hotel and I heard everything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The walls are thin as paper</span> as i heard every conversation from the room next door. I apprectiate that some builings in boston are older, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>if you own a hotel you must do something ot soudnproof it</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Favourite hotel</span> in Boston. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Modern luxury</span> without seeming formulaic. Good for indulgent weekends in town.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a superb elegant but modern hotel that truly deserves its high-star rating.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is a little pricey however well-worth it because it exceeds all expectations.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has easy travel into the city centre as as well as in walking distance to all the major sights you may wish to see.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were elegant with a fireplace and comfortable beds.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">However the walls were quite thin.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff were attentive and accommodating to all needs, even as far as the hotel car service etc.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The range of foods provided by the hotel were excellent.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">One thing to note about the hotel is that the sink taps were on too tight to use properly.</span></div></div>
