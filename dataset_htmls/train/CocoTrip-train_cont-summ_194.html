<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed for 3 nights recently. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is good</span>, very short walk to the boardwalk and beach. It's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>close enough to walk to the main busy part of the boardwalk but far enough away to be quiet</span>. The outside is a little dated but everything was clean. Our 5th floor room had a nice view of both the ocean and the bay. The balcony was a good size as well. We fit 4 adults comfortably for our whole stay. Remember to ask for sheets for the pullout sofa if you are going to use it as they were not in the room. We also only had 1 clothes hanger. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff was easy to deal with but had lost my paperwork</span> so there was a little wait at check-in. I would probably stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband, daughter and I stayed at The Spinnaker last week and it was great! I am really picky and I can't find one thing negative to say. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The view was great, just steps to the boardwalk</span>, the beds were really comfortable and so were the pillows, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the housekeeping was great</span> (Alice), the room was big and the kitchen was more than adequate. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff</span> in the office <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>were friendly and efficient</span>. I asked for an extra chair for the balcony and it was there before I even hung up the phone. We didn't use the pool but it looked clean and there is a huge sundeck. Most of all, the place was CLEAN! We can't wait to go back next year.</div><div class='text-box'>This motel is right next door to the $500+/night Holiday Inn - where my brother was staying. The beds & sheets were soft & comfortable. The air conditioner was a little noisy but kept the room nice & cool. The room was quiet & roomy enough. The kitchenette was clean, with a pretty large refrigerator. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Location was great</span> & the restaurant was good. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff</span> at the front desk <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>friendly & helpful</span>. Probably my only complaint would be the horrible sleeper sofa - definitely in sorry shape - hard to sleep or sit on. We ended up pulling the mattress out & putting it on the floor. It wasn't the Ritz but it was an OK place to stay & we would most likely go back.</div><div class='text-box'>We just stayed at the Spinnaker on August 5-9, 2012. There were 5 of us. 2 adults & three teens. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Steps from the boardwalk</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were</span> nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Very quiet</span>. Bathroom is a bit small for 5 people but we managed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We had breakfast one morning at the cafe</span>, BEST bacon egg & cheese sandwich that I have ever had! We were having such a good time that we wanted to stay an extra night but unfortunetly they did not have one room available. So we had to go elsewhere. We went next door to the Siharra. What a mistake! Smelly Dump! Doesn't compare to the Spinnaker. WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY STAY AT THE SPINNAKER AGAIN!</div><div class='text-box'>This motel was such a great surprise.a diamond in the rough! We stayed from Sept 3rd till the 6th. We had more in that room than any room in a high class place. Never had to buy ice.just kept on filling the trays and filling our cooler! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was spotless and the staff was so friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We only went to the cafe once and that wasn't</span> a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>great</span> experience.but there are a million other places to go. We left clothes in the room when we left and I called and the woman at the front desk was so great about it and sent them to us right away! Thanks! We'll be back next year for sure!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for 4 nights recently. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>quiet but</span> still <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>close to all the action on the boardwalk</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>walk to the beach took less then 1 minute</span> - which was awesome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were clean for the most part.</span> The hotel is very dated, but for the price you can not complain. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff was fantastic</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>There is a great little</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>cafe</span> called Malia's Place <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>attached to the hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We had breakfast there every morning</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>staff</span> and food <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>were</span> both <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>excellent</span>. This was a bonus!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the spinnaker motel for 4th of july weekend. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>motel is not on the ocean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>does not have</span> much of an ocean <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>view</span>. The outside of the hotel is dirty looking including the pool. The motel does not have a bar by the pool. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms are</span> not very up to date but are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span>. On the good side if you have to stay here the cleaning <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>service did a good jog</span> on the rooms. The restaraunt has good food but sometime a wait.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here over Labor Day weekend, our second time here. Check in quick and easy, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms are very clean and the maid service is great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Great view of the beach even though not oceanfront</span>. Pool was always clean and the deck is great. My daughter and I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>had lunch there that we got from the hotel's</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>cafe</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Had</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a great breakfast there as well</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very nice staff</span>! As for the WiFi don't know.ON VACATION! Whatever did people do without it?</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The location is great.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">On the beach and the quiet end of the boardwalk.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The service was great and the room was clean.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">There is a small cafe on the premises for breakfast and lunch.</span></div></div>
