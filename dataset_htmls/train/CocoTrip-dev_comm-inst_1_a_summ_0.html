<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>The Residence Inn was great. Very central to lots of things but the people working there were what made the stay so enjoybale. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Leyla at the front desk was so helpful</span> in guiding us as to what to do and never without a big smile on her face. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Franco at the valet was so friendly and helpful</span> and since he was our very frist imprerssion of the Residence Inn it certainly was a good one. The breakfast was great but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>again the staff was wonderful. Kemika (sp) was so helpful and warm</span> and it certainly made for an enjoyable breakfast time with our family. The rooms were clean and modern. The parking charge was the only downfall at $35 a day. It would be better to include it in the room price.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I was treated very horribly by the staff at this hotel</span>, I would not recommend it to anyone no matter who you are. Maybe its because they are new they don't know how to treat guests but I can tell you this much they ruined my entire stay and never bothered to do anything about it,until I took action. I am disappointed that a Marriott would act like this, but atleast now you know that they are not capable of effectively dealing with problem resolution during your stay.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at this hotel numerous times since it opened. I love the location, and the kitchenette in the rooms makes any hotel stay so much more comfortable. Of course, one can never complain about complementary breakfast! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff has</span> always <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>been</span> super friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span>, from the maintenance and housekeeping staff, to the front desk and valet. Every time I go to Toronto I look forward to staying there!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the residence inn over a weekend. After a Long drive from chicago we were assigned a room on a high floor as requested with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a lovely view of the cn tower</span>! The hotel is in the perfect spot for exploring the surrounding area and has lots of pubs and restaurants in close vicinity also! Book it, you won't be dissapointed :)</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>5 Minutes walking distance to</span> both the Rogers Centre and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>CN Tower</span>. Also walking distance to all the nightclubs in the entertainment district. Rooms are brand new and kept spotlessly clean. This property is also reasonably priced with the AAA discount. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this property.</div><div class='text-box'>A thank you party for the clients on our first night, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff very polite</span> and room very clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Close to the CN tower</span> and King street, well located. The fact that you have a complete kitchen and a very nice breakfast included also are some of the reasons to go back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights in August. Excellent location next to the CN Tower. Lovely room with full kitchen - handy with young children - excellent deli round the corner which made preparing meals easier etc. - less stressful than taking youngsters to restaurants. Absolutely superb breakfast each morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Courteous staff throughout</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have been staying in Residence Inn for the ast 5 months and its by far the best extended stay hotel I have ever visited. Excelent location,Food and Guest Services</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff have been okay at this hotel and sometimes were great and helpful but at times they wouldn't treat guests incredibly well.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is also located near to CN Tower.</span></div></div>
