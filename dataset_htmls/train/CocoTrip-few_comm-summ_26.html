<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Since I found this place 5 years ago, whenever I go to Branson, this is where we choose. It's away from the Branson chaos, beautiful quiet location and we always choose the lakeview condos. We don't have a boat so the marina down at Indian Point it perfectly located if we get in the mood to rent something. We're opposite the Silver Dollar City traffic if we want to go into town during the day and we're less than a mile away if we want to go to the park. It may be a bit of a drive if someone is intensely interested in going downtown or on the Strip a lot but the roads are good and it's not that big a deal for me! We always stay in the 2-bedroom condos, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it's such a relaxing, roomy place to stay</span>, so much better for us than staying on the Strip.</div><div class='text-box'>We celebrated my husband's birthday with a trip to Branson and a stay at The Village. We enjoyed it very much. The view from the deck is our favorite. We have our meals on the deck and love to sit out and relax and listen to the sounds of nature, read and listen to our "tunes." Just one minor detail. We couldn't find the coffee. Everything else was there, handy and available, but no coffee. Hopefully next time it will be available.</div><div class='text-box'>This is our second time staying at the Village at Indian Point. We are already planning to stay again next year, and bring the rest of family too. The condo was very clean and staff very friendly. The only complaint that we were on the second level and the people above us were up all night long. We could hear their bed squeak when they got in and out of it. Other than that, everything was GREAT! See you next year! The Elder Family</div><div class='text-box'>We have adult children and we wanted to try out a condo for comfort and convenience. To our surprise, check in was easy even though we arrived late at night. The staff was helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The condo was</span> clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>comfortable</span>. The view was beautiful. I had some concerns about value for my money, but it was money well spent. We hope to return for another family weekend in the future.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I loved the rustic lodge look nestled amongst the trees. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>unit was</span> tastefully decorated and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>well maintained</span>. Our unit faced the lake and we enjoyed having coffee on the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>large covered patio</span>. This place is much better than staying in a hotel. We will definitely return.</div><div class='text-box'>Village at Indian Point is awesome! Great location on the lake, wonderful staff and nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean condos</span>. The nature trails, pools, game room, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hot tub and private dock</span> sweeten the deal. We love this place and will keep coming back!</div><div class='text-box'>We held a family reunion at The Village At Indian Point. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The accommodations were very comfortable</span> with beautiful views. We had a great time. I would enjoy a trip back there.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location and beautiful area and scenery, Very quiet, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere! Will definitely will be staying here again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel are very comfortable.</span></div></div>
