<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This was my second time in Venice and I learnt the hard way that it is a good idea to pick <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a hotel near to the train station</span> if you have luggage! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel meets this requirement</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is cheap for Venetian</span> standards but the value for money is not so good compared to other cities. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>A full breakfast was advertised</span> when I booked. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>What was provided was very far from that - two bread rolls, jam, coffee and juice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small but okay</span>. The shared bathroom was not so good. Poor water pressure and not much of a barrier between the shower and the rest of the room. In terms of location I would recommend this hotel however some simple adjustments need to be made to service and maintenance before recommending overall.</div><div class='text-box'>This was the second time that my husband and I stayed here, and we still found it to be a good value for a very expensive city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It's conveniently located near the train station</span>, so you don't have to drag your bags all over the city and up and down stairs. Both times we stayed on the first floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were small but comfortable and clean</span>, and the bathrooms were tiny, but clean and usable. Since the hotel is at the end of a small alley, it's fairly quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast is very basic</span>, but the coffee is good and the rolls are fresh, so that was fine by us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you're looking for a place to comfortably sleep and shower, then this hotel is great</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotel Rossi is a 'budget hotel' by Venice standards. I did a lot of research before booking this Hotel and this came recommended from a friend who had stayed there a year before. The room was small but big enough. Could have been bigger if it did not have so much unnecessary furniture. It was very quiet. We choose a ground floor room because we were travelling with a baby and did not want to carry a pram and luggage upstairs. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast was basic but fine</span> and a good way to start the day. The woman who served the breakfast was very very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The front desk staff were a bit cool but ok</span>. The Hotel is very conveniently located. I would recommend to others travelling to Venice.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the only thing good about Hotel Rossi is its location</span> close to the train station down a little street and so it was quiet. No matter what you couldn't get lost as the direction indicators on the walls in Venice always indicated either the way to the station or San Marco square. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast was stale bread and jam</span>/honey /butter <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and reasonably decent coffee</span> in a tight little room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room we slept in was never swept.dust balls accumulated under the bed in our 4 night stay.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Only stairs to get up to the floors</span>. The cot for our teenage son was uncomfortable. Fortunately we rarely spent anytime there.</div><div class='text-box'>Great value for a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>no frills room</span>. We had a one night stay and I couldn't be happier. Had to get up the following morning and hit Piazzale Roma to get to the airport so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location was perfect</span>. The room we had faced a courtyard so it was nice and quiet. If we were there for a longer stay, I might look for something else. This is not the best place if you plan on spending a lot of time IN the room however, you're in Venice so that shouldn't be too much of an issue.</div><div class='text-box'>We were passing through by car so this hotel worked out very well in that the parking was easy and free, yet <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the location was</span> still <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>close to town and the train station</span>. The walk into town was about 15-20 minutes, or the hotel has bikes that you can use. The bikes were all checked out when we arrived so if you know you want to use them it is best to reserve them in advance. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The room wasn't anything fancy but the hotel was clean and acceptable</span> for a 2 or 3 star type hotel.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is nothing out of the ordinary</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were kind of small</span>, but that is expected in Italy. I have certainly seen smaller rooms. The bathroom in the single room was also tiny. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>But the shared bathroom was</span> much larger and also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast was ok, nothing great</span>. The best thing about the hotel was that it was pretty cheap for Venice and it was very close to the train station (5 minutes at most). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Staff spoke English well</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Rossi for a few days in December and enjoyed a lot. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel position is excellent</span> in a small private street away from the crowd, very near to the railways station and close to the waterbuses pier , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>the room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>not so large but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and comfortable</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast good even if essential</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>friendly staff</span> and reasonable price for Venice. For a future visit in this wonderful city weall surely stay at the Rossi again.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a great location but a very average hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has no lift.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">We found the staff particularly unfriendly and unhelpful.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very very basic but clean.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast is very basic, 4 bread rolls and jam and coffee.</span></div></div>
