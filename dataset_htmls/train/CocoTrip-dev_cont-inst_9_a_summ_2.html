<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I were in November 2006 for one night only and paid with reward points. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wish have stayed longer</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Nice and superclean clean modern hotel</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> superb breakfast</span> with plenty of variety and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 9'>fresh capuccino made in front of you</span>, and very helpful and polite staff both in reception and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>breakfast room</span> that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>makes your stay even more enjoyable</span>. Even thought <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>not in centre of Rome</span>, close enough by public transportation very easy and accesible: bus line 85 runs often one block from hotel, takes you to Colesseum and near Trevi? Metro linea B, about 5 blocks from hotel takes you to centre or Ananigna to take bus to Ciampino, and train to Fiumicino airport 2-3 blocks from hotel: only 5 euros takes you in a bit without stops. Only problem with Metro line B is that stopped working after 9:00PM. Hope it changes soon, but still OK. Would definitely reccomend hotel to anybody and cannot wait to go back now in June for 2 nights.</div><div class='text-box'>We (a family of 9 including a toddler & an adolescent) went there last October. Having stayed at a new Holiday Inn Express in Milan last year, we were hoping to repeat the same 3-star experience. The receptionists were accomodating/business-like. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>We rented a van & had to pay 12 parking/night</span>. However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>everybody was disappointed with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the small</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>room</span> (triple BR), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>old stained pillows & sheets</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>cleanliness</span> & service. The only time that we opened our window was on the last day of our stay (it rained) & was shocked to find out that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>the window sill was full of black molds</span>. My son had his first asthma attack when we went home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I've just read another review from a previous guest abt. 2 months ago stating the same problem with the molds/mildew</span>. Obviously, the hotel didn't do anything about it.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Rome - San Giovanni for 3 nights during our 8 day trip in Italy. On our last morning, we were told to leave our baggage at the lobby while <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>breakfast</span> and we did. When we returned, we sadly found out that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>one of our baggage, the one containing most of our gifts, was missing</span>. Since we wouldn't be able to go back and get new ones, it was really devastating for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The staff members were not even slighly interested in the situation</span>. We asked for police assistance but they didn't even bother to call; saying the police could do nothing about it. Nobody asked about what happened or anything; as if nothing had happened. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The apathy, the staff members showed, made us regretfully think that some of them may have something to do with the robbery</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Rome San Giovanni simply going by what others had to say about the place in Tripadvisor. I am glad I did that. I got a good price on the hiexpress website by booking in advance. Though <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel is not right in the heart of the city</span>, it is a very convenient to get there by bus. We also used the sub way station but that was a longer walk. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>rooms are very clean</span> and modern. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>front desk staff are helpful</span> . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast was good with a lot of choice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definitely stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the hotel from January 26 to January 31 and the service over all is really great, but there is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>nothing or none that matches service, attention, dedication and compromise with the client</span> than SIMONE DI PORTO and ALESSANDRA COPPOCA, both of them really are committed and love what they do, always aware of what you need and willing to help you. ANd these review is coming from a long term priority club member with Platinum Status, besides the deco of the hotel and overall was good. Hope to go back to the same hotel</div><div class='text-box'>We Were only in rome for 2 days and 2 nights and found Express a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>good place for a short stay</span>. At first we thought the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>area looked a bit Dodgey But compared to Rome centre it is not too bad</span>. There is a nice Restaurant (Sacco) just around the corner which, although a little pricey, is very pleasant. It is very close to the Station, Just a 10 minute walk and another 10 to Termini Station. Also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>There is free parking just outside reception</span></div><div class='text-box'>This is a good hotel, it is very decent , nice rooms(though <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I'm not sure if it has air conditioning</span>), it is very close to the Metro, which was our main transportation throughout our trip. it also has a bus station a minute away that is also very usefull. Money well spent!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Very clean rooms</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>super friendly and helpful staff</span>. We checked in early in the morning and were accommodated without charge. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast was perfect</span>. Make sure you <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 9'>get a few free cappuccino's from the Barista</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The Nescafe machine is fine</span> but the cappuccino's from the barrista (Coffee Bar) are better.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">An excellent hotel that comes highly recommended for short stays in Rome.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is not based in the city centre.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Well maintained rooms, that are cleaned to a reasonable standard.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">However, there is an issue with black mould around the windows, and there is no air conditioning available.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Generally speaking the staff at this hotel are disinterested and apathetic.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast at the hotel is good and offers a variety of options</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">and you can get a free cappuccino from the barista.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Car or van rental is an option but comes with a parking fee of 12 a night.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Also, there is a Nescafe coffee machine which is ok</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">but a barista is located nearby.</span></div></div>
