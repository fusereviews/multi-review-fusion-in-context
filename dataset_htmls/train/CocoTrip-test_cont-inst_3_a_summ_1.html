<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This is my second stay at the Pullman Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Billed as a five star hotel. My view is its more like a 4* hotel</span>, well situated in Barcelona, not too far from the 5 star establishment , the Arts Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's a functional business Hotel</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>all the room amenities, (</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>fast wi-fi in room</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>multi channel TV</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> Bath and shower, modern ( art deco) , nice roomy lobby etc</span>. on <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>most nights the restaurant was not</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>open for dinner though the chef was flexible to prepare dinner for a small party per- arranged</span>. We were not disappointed with the food. Tasty and well presented with generous portions Rooms are mid size and comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>but pricey</span> ( it was GSM congress week, I guess).</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A great hotel</span> for a weekend break. We thought the breakfast spread was excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 8'>Our room with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>a balcony and sea view was perfect</span> and the sea breeze was lush. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Everything was in good condition</span> - smart bathrooms and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>good facilities</span>. Only gripe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>would be crappy pillows and not the softest linen on the beds</span> but i suppose one can always find something to complain about (or at least i can!) The kids with the families tended to stay <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>downstairs</span> in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the lower pool</span> area leaving the younger set (us) to chill by the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>more modern pool on the roof</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3'>The location was great as it's a minute form the beach</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and it's a short walk or cab into town</span>. well recommended</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very good</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>close to the party-beach-area</span>:<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> 1 minute walking</span>! We got a room with sea view at 5th floor left wing which is great since the sun stays very long on the balcony. Distance to old town (picasso museum) is about 15 minutes onwards. Staff is superior: very friendly and very helpful! Fitness: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8 9'>fitness centre in the hotel is tiny</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>but there is a fitness park about 2 minutes walking distance</span> for 16eur/day which provide a good facility. Fun: we were using <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the jacuzzi on the roof top</span> few times. Very cool sitting there, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>enjoy a glass of wine and overlooking Barcelona</span>. I will be here again!</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at the hotel or 4 nights in August 2010. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything about this hotel is 5 star and is a def hotel</span> I wold stay in again if i stayed in barcelona. Breakfast was lovely and catered for all people(very impressed). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8 9'>Hotel has 2 pools</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>which were fantastic</span> My only negatives were 1. No English tv stations 2. Mini bar was very expensive so avoid at all costs FYI - If you don't want to be ripped off with expensive meals then avoid the sea front! We paid 55 euros for 2 pasta dishes and 2 fizzy drinks!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a thru 5 star hotel</span> with excellent service. I can really recommend this hotel. It has very attentive staff. I had a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>great room</span> (first floor 116), quiet, spacy, clean and very nicely decorated. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8 9'>hotel has 2 great pools</span>; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>1 roof top pool with bar</span> and 1 pool on the ground level. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is situated close to</span> the Port Olympic, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the Beach</span> and Barcelonetta. So <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a great location</span>. It is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>great hotel for a combined city / beach vacation</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>A beautiful hotel next to the beach</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with impeccable customer service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are nice</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the pool is great</span>, but the hotel's greatest asset is the staff, who really go out of their way to treat all of their guests like they are special. Even though we are definitely not one of their high-revenue customers, everyone in the hotel treated us like we were royalty. I highly recommend the Pullman Skipper.</div><div class='text-box'>Though one short block off the actual sand, the place has great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>beaches in both directions</span>. If you don't want the beach, there's a very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>fine rooftop pool</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>views of the sea</span>. There's also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>a nice cafe</span> right beside it with good, affordable breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It's not cheap</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very nice</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotel was very trendy, loved the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>bathroom</span> which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was utterly luxurious</span>:) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>large tv</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>comfortable bed</span>. Breakfast was good too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Staff were extremely</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful with advice and hints on getting around the city</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is definitely worth its five star rating, although it is expensive.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideal for a combined city and beach holiday.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is set so close to the beach that you will not need to walk too far.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Additionally there are wonderful views from the top of the hotel, reminding you of what a great location you are staying in.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The bed in the room didn't have the softest linen and the pillows weren't great either, but the bed itself was comfortable and everything was in good condition.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There is WiFi in the room as well as a nice big television.</span><span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had a lovely bar/restaurant overlooking Barcelona, but be warned that it can be expensive.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Also note that the restaurant is not available every day, but they can be flexible in providing catering on request.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has some great facilities.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">There are two pools, a rooftop Jacuzzi and a fitness centre all within the hotel.</span></div></div>
