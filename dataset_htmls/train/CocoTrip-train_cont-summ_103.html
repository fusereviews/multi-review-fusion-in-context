<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>The room was very nice and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 4th floor and had a great view of the Eiffel tower. I like the small, 2 person, elevator but it would be claustrophobic to some. No free breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We were at the corner of the Rue Cler</span> which is a less touristy part of Paris and close to the tower. The service of the staff was good as expected however, they were not overly friendly as compared to other hotel staff in other counties we stayed at during our tour of Europe. They didn't interact with us much, such as recommending places to eat at or visit. The staff did say we could leave our backpacks there the day of checkout when we asked.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in this hotel for three nights in June 2011, and though that it was great. The room we had overlooked the street (which is pedestrianised) but the double glazing prevented this being a problem. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The room was small</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but had everything that we needed</span>, including a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>bathroom</span> which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was recently refurbished</span>. We had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>breakfast</span> in the hotel breakfast room on the last morning we were there, and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>was excellent value</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There are two brasseries on either side of</span> the street just outside <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel, and shops and a supermarket</span> (plus of course lots more restaurants and cafes) in the vicinity. It is about 6 minutes walk to the nearest Metro station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>All in all, a good place to stay</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>A very good place to stay and a good price</span> compared to other hotels we considered. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was small</span>, but we really didn't spend that much time in it. The bed was comfortable and the room was well tended. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We only had the breakfast there once</span> (when there are so many cafes in that neighborhood alone, why eat in your room?), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>but it was good</span> and a decent price-within .50 euros more or less of most cafes. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was friendly and helpful</span> when we needed them. Our room was away from the street with a window that opened up onto a courtyard and very quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>We would recommend it and we would stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We visited Paris for the first time in June 2010 and booked the Hotel du Champ De Mars . The hotel was recommended by several known guide books. We feel very fortunate to have found such a nice hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff were very friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms were very spacious (</span>compared to the other ones we stayed in Europe), clean <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and quaint</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 7'>The neighbourhood</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel is located in </span>(<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Rue Cler</span>)<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 7'>is fantastic</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Great little shops and cafes</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would stay there again</span>. We have already recommended the hotel to several people who will be visiting Paris soon.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I felt this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>was a good value</span>. The hotel is a bit worn, but definitely clean. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was small</span>. I laughed at people who mentioned that in their review prior to my stay. I still enjoyed it, but lauged when I realized I had been warned! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff was unfriendly at best</span>. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>loved the location</span>. A very charming neighborhood and close to the Eiffel Tower. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>would</span> recommend this hotel and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>stay again</span>. Friendly staff would be nice, but we'd prefer a great value.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel du Champ de Mars in November and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had a really nice stay</span>. The hotel was in a great area filled with interesting restaurants, cafes and shops. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is also in</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>a fabulous location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>for touring Paris</span>; close to the Eiffel Tower, Invalides and several Metro stops. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was on the small side but very nicely decorated</span>, and with a wonderful view of the top of the Eiffel Tower. All of this for a wonderful price; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>I</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>would definitely stay again</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel</span> for four nights in August, 2005. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was very small</span>, but who stays in the room when in Paris? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The owners</span> speak excellent English, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>provided excellent suggestions and directions</span>. Our room was next to the elevator, but we didn't notice any annoying noise from it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is near the Eiffel tower (a 5- 10 minute walk) and the neighborhood is full of nice restaurants and pastry shops</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>We'd definitely stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This was a lovely</span> quaint <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel</span> and the staff were very helpful. I especially liked the reception area with its cute little chairs and books of history of the area in Paris. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small</span> but very clean and comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location was fantastic</span>! So close to Eiffel Tower and lovely restaurants. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>Would definitely stay here again</span>!<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'></span> Thank you for a wonderful stay and being very helpful!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Really loved this place and would definitely stay here again.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The best part about the hotel is the location.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Being in the Rue Cler area was idyllic.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Our room was very charmingly decorated, though very small.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The bathroom was small too, but nicely updated and very clean.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The owners of the hotel were very nice and helpful.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast croissants were really good!</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">For the value and location, we would definitely stay here again!</span></div></div>
