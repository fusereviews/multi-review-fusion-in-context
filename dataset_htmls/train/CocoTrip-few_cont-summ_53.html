<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Olimpia over the new year holiday for four nights. It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>everything it claims to be and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>it</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>looks just like the photos on the website</span>. The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room staff was great too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The Hotel is located about a minutes walk from the vaporetto station</span>. You should buy an extended vaporetto pass if you are going to be in town for a stretch of time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The railway station was a short three minute walk away</span>, and St. Mark's Square took about 1 hour at a leisurely pace to reach.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotel is quietly situated, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>well located for the trains, buses and vaporetto</span>. It is very clean and comfortable with friendly and efficient staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Excellent selection for breakfast</span>. I developed a health problem whilst in Venice and the reception staff could not have been more helpful and supportive in assisting me to resolve the matter. I would certainly stay at this hotel if we return to Venice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our only criticism would be that the room was a little on the small side</span> but as we spent a great deal of time sightseeing it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>If you are cruising, this a great location</span>. We walked from cruise terminal to Piaza Roma. The hotel is visible from the Piaza. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>You can get to the airport by bus, cab, or water taxi practically from the front door</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>had a nice view</span>. We left the window and shutters open and it still was not too noisy, although there is activity going on almost all night. Small but usable elevator, which you don't always get. The location and ease of travel made it worth the price.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel was very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was quite beautiful, very large by Venice standards, with a canal view</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>good breakfast</span>. The only complaint is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it is near the end of a vaparato route</span>, and too far to walk at night from San Marco (unless you are actually familiar with the streets and alleys of Venice.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The restaurant, Brucinellis, in the same building was not so great</span>. The bass was very disappointing, and I believe they refill the water bottles with tap water.</div><div class='text-box'>A 3 euro ticket from the airport takes you to Plaza da Roma in 15 mins, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you can see the hotel as you get off the bus</span>, A 2 minute walk up steps along small bridge and down steps brings you to Hotel Olimpia. We arrived at Marco Polo at 9p.m by 10p.m we had checked in and were eating supper overlooking canal by hotel-magical.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms very pretty</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>not big</span>, but comfortable.Breakfast plentiful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Very convenient for leaving luggage there when checking out</span>.Would definetly stay there again, not cheap though.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a good hotel, cold air conditioning, warm and friendly staff, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>only two bridges from train station</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>one bridge from Water busses</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and Piazzaie Roma</span>. They have tables with an awning outside their front door so you can sit and have some wine and enjoy Venice. A good restaurant is right next door and the staff will tell which ones in the area to avoid.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights prior to our cruise, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the hotel is very conveniently located transportation wise</span> from the airport and pier. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the breakfast was very good</span>. The only note is that the shower was actually smaller than the one on the ship. Great hotel, I would stay there again and recommend it to friends.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Located close to bus station need to take 2 bridges to get here from the train station</span>. Everything is close by in venice, front-desk person was super nice and very talkative. Have to climb 4 floors to go our room, luckily the doorman helped us with the luggages. Stayed here one night and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>they stored our luggage</span> for free.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's advertisement was spot on and exactly as promised.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is closely located to trains, buses and the waterbus or the vaporetto station is within easy walking distance too.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">A great location for cruising.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The tooms tend to be small but beautiful and have nice views onto the canal.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The food was ok but not great.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is just as good in person as it is in its photos and website.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">They allow you to leave your luggage with them after checking out which is very convenient.</span></div></div>
