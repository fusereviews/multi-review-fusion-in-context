<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This place can be summed up in one word . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>flawless</span> ! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Located across the street from</span> the most beautiful beach in Key West - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Smathers Beach</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>literally 1.7 miles from Duval street</span> it is prefect! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 9'>The service was fantastic</span>, the grounds are very well kept, with a cool pool. and the piece de Resistance . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the room</span> - comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>huge, it is literally the size of a small apartment</span>, with a small kitchenette, a dining table a huge couch and and super <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable bed</span>, oh yeah and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathroom is also pretty darn big</span>. We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Since we brought our bikes</span>, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel</span>. don't own a bike? Or don't feel like shipping them down with you ? No problem, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>the hotel has plenty of bikes for rent as well</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel has a great location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>across from the beach</span> and away from Duval street, but a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>free shuttle</span> every hour into town and airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Rooms are all suites</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>large</span> and comfortable with microwave and wet bars, living room areas , well designed space with pocket doors to close off the bedroom for privacy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Comfortable beds</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>nice vanity area</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>lots of storage space</span>. We were a large group and treated very well. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7 9'>The restaurant staff was particularly accomodating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7 9'>As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7 9'>Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible</span>. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Restaurant closed at 9 and bar at 11pm, a little early for our crowd</span> and Key West but that is my only complaint.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>decorated beautifully for X-mas and I loved the Palm trees with Christmas lights</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7 9'>The staff was very helpful and friendly</span>. The rate was what is to be expected for Key West, right by the airport! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>The beach is across the street from the hotel</span> with multiple activities for one to participate in. Since the hotel is out of the was a smidge, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>they offer shuttles, numerous shuttles to all the hot spots in Key West</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were</span> beautiful, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very clean</span>, unless you looked directly behind the toilet, which could use a little extra scrubbing. I would stay here again, tomorrow!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is an all suite hotel</span> so the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>rooms were very spacious</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>allowed us to kick back</span> in our room mid afternoons and mornings. If you like a slower pace and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>a public beach across the street</span>, this is a good place to stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>You will have to drive or take the shuttle to Duval Street area</span> and the shuttle is only once an hour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>Parking in the Duval Street area will cost from $10 to $35 per day</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I took my girlfriend here for a long weekend and to propose. The hotel was great, obviously, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it wasn't a St Regis or even a Westin</span>, but it was very nice, very functional and enjoyable. The food and services were VERY expensive. I thought they took care of us well even though we were staying on points for free.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>This hotel has huge rooms</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>bathrooms</span> and is in a great location <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>across from the beach</span> and close to the airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Great food in the restaurant and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 9'>staff is wonderful</span>! I highly recommend to anyone needing some extra space and doesnt care about being downtown!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>Large</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> modern,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>across from</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>one of the few</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>beaches</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>in Key West</span>. While far from downtown, this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel offers a lot of comfort</span>, a nice little pool, and regular shuttle service. We would stay there again!</div><div class='text-box'>We went to enjoy Key West and our daughters were so excited and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this motel was a complete disappointment</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Dirty</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>unsafe</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>only thing really redone was the lobby</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 10'>Elevators were very scary</span>, our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>daughters would not even ride without us</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Overall, as an all-suite hotel, the place was great.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It's not the fanciest, but it was beautifully decorated for Christmas with lights on the palm trees and it was very enjoyable.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">In the restaurant, the staff was very good.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Fantastic service.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The food and staff was great.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used.</span> <span id="11" class="summary-sentence">Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too.</span></div></div>
