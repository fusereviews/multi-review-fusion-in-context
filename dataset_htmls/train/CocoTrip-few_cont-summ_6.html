<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We had a pleasant stay at hotel playa karma. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's located on a busy street so</span> if you're a light sleeper, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the traffic might bother you</span> at night. We did hear the dog a couple of times but was it was only for a few minutes. Overall, I was impressed with their customer service. The staff was very nice and accomodating. Mario was very friendly. We arranged a couple of tours with karma trails and we were happy with the tours we chose. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Antonello arranged a breakfast-to-go box before we headed out to one of our tours in the morning and it was abundant, filled with fruits, bread, water and cake</span>. If you prefer a hotel with great customer service, choose hotel playa karma.</div><div class='text-box'>We had a wonderful time at Playa del Karma! We finished our Yucatan-trip with 2 nights, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere</span>. We had two several rooms (one at the garden and one above the lobby/reception), both really nice with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>lots of space</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>big beds</span>! The Italian people who run this place are really helpful with everything you need and provide great service with the breakfast buffet (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we loved the mexican eggs in the morning</span>) and free beachtowels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Playa del Karma is a lovely place with a beautiful garden with a small but wonderful pool, lovely to relax after a day at the beach</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel is a great value, the service is very friendly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the inner courtyard with small pool and lights strung across palm trees is a lovely oasis</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms are clean</span> and equipped with AC, tv and small deposit box. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>There was a high vaulted thatched roof which made the room feel airy but unfortunately not too sound proof</span>. Right across from the new ADO bus station so a good place to stay if you are catching an early morning bus from the station. Just a couple blocks from 5th ave where all the action happens at Playa.</div><div class='text-box'>For those of us baby boomers who remember being sensitive flower children <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel Play del Karma</span> really suited us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The mature greenery of the courtyard had the serenity and grace of years of wise existence</span>; of course we could relate! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>patter of raindrops</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>on</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>the thatched roof</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>of the room</span> reminded us that we were in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beautiful tropical climate</span>. It was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a charming effect</span> that would have been absent had we stayed in a concrete & glass megalith. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfasts above the garden</span> were special.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at Playa del Karma on a recommendation from a friend. We were extremely satisfied with the accomadations and the staff. This hotel was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the best hotel I've ever stayed at in terms of value for what you receive</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cute</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>a little rustic but clean and comfortable</span>), the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>courtyard is beautiful</span> and the staff went above and beyond to serve us or answer questions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>just three blocks from the beach</span>. We would definitely come back.</div><div class='text-box'>This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>little hotel is lovely with nice rooms with a lot of character</span>. Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Free breakfast at their sister hotel about a five minute away is</span> nothing special but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>very good</span>. Only problem was that the hot water didn't last very long, but everything else was perfect.</div><div class='text-box'>Very good 3 star <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel a few blocks from beach</span>.Everyone very helpful.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Rooms large</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with patios and hammocks,nice little courtyard</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>with small pool</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Small but very comfortable rooms</span>. Extremely helpfull staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>No private parking</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Near all of 5th Ave fun</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has an enjoyable ambience and is great value for money.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This location is great if you're looking to access the great fun and action close-by, but with that comes hustle-and-bustle noise from the street the hotel is located on.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rustic rooms here are a little small but really comfortable and clean while the beds are big.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">There was a thatched roof to the room that provided an airy feel but of course not soundproof.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides great breakfast to be eaten above the garden or to take away.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel does not provide private parking unfortunately.</span></div></div>
