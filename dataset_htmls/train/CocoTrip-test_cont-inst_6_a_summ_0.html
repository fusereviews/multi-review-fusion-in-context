<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Returned yesterday from a 2 night stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam with my wife and 11 year old son and have to say what a joy it was,from the initial welcoming cup of tea to the final goodbye it was a superb experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is very centrally located</span> just a 10 minute walk from the Central Station and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>next to a charming canal</span> and although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms are on the small</span> side(we had the mini-suite in the loft which had a tricky low ceiling! and generally traditional Amsterdam hotels are on the small side) they are beautifully decorated and very cosy with high quality furnishings.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Just look out for the steep stairs if you have large suitcases it can be hard work</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast was typically continental</span> with cold meats,cereals and a lovely selection of bread ,fresh juice and good coffee etc.served in a smart little dining room with a tv showing BBC news. What set this place apart for me was the service from all the staff who went out of their way to help and make us feel special-we have used many hotels in the US and Europe and can honestly say this hotel is right at the top when it comes to service,nothing was too much trouble. Would not hesitate in returning to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is located in Jordaan, beautiful district with very cozy restaurants. The hotel has modern looks, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>great breakfast</span>, and the staff are nice and friendly. I stayed in room 342, which is in the third floor, and has two twin beds. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was OK</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>but</span> I do have to say that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>each bed was extremely small</span>! 68 cm wide (which is very small) I actually asked the staff if this was normal, and they said that in Amsterdam hotels it is normal. Apart from this, I would recommend the hotel, but I would make sure, before making the reservation that they book you a room with normal sized beds. Oh, also, the room rate doesn't include breakfast (which was 7 euros, more or less)</div><div class='text-box'>I was in this hotel during 4 days, and it was perfect. Staff is really kind,they help us in any moment. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast for free</span> and also tea and coffe. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Internet</span> too <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>for free</span>. The hotel is only 5 minutes from central station, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it is placed</span> in the best area of Amsterdam, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in the city center</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Very nice room</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>so clean and beatifull</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>with canal view</span>. In my opinion, the hotel style is great, it is different, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>prices are ok</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span></div><div class='text-box'>Hotels in Amsterdam is not cheap. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>This hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>has a reasonable price</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>has an excellent location near the central station</span> but still in a very nice area, Jordaan. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The rooms</span> (we chose a L) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>are of a good size</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and reasonably clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The "continental breakfast" was toast and jam, with coffee or tea</span>, which was kind of a let down. But, at this price and location, it's a great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>The staff were friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was</span> comfortable but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>small</span>. We believe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>they cater for a gay market</span>, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>gay pornography left in the common areas</span> offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a small hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>located about a 5 minute walk from the Central Station in a quiet neighborhood in Amsterdam</span>. The staff is friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the rooms are simple and clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Most rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>tend to be a little small</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>generally a pretty good value</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>They provide a breakfast which unfortunately is only bread/toast and jelly/jam</span> but there are plaves to eat nearby. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>They also offer free wireless internet</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this just last week. Great place to stay, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>free</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>internet</span>. Just have to wait for everyone to log off so you can get on. Even books to read if you don't want to sightsee in a number of languages. Coffee and tea available all the time as well - free! Really close to everything as well.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>very good value for money</span>. great location, great service, great room, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>great breakfast</span> wish there was one of these hotels in every city</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The price of staying at this hotel was reasonable.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located in the city centre and right next to a canal.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel can be small and with little beds.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are good value and are clean and well furnished.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The continental breakfast was a bit limited but it did taste great and it was provided by the hotel for free.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel did provide free internet access.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">However, be warned of the steep stairs if you have heavy luggage.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is gay friendly, but there are homosexual pornographic materials left out in public areas.</span></div></div>
