<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed here over Memorial Day weekend 2012. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I think this hotel is a steal if you catch it on an off-season weekend</span> when the prices are lower. In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The complimentary breakfast was great</span>, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>Love the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>courtyard and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>pool</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>- very upscale feeling, but cozy</span> and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>there's no housekeeping after midnight</span>, so we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>had to walk down to get the extra towels</span> the housekeeper never left. Also we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled</span>, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the service was outstanding</span>, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>recommend this place to my friends</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>This modern, boutique hotel was clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and well-maintained</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The beds were heavenly</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall</span>, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>. The staff was extremely helpful</span>, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The best part of the hotel is</span> that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Being able to walk to key landmarks</span>, check out local art galleries and antiques, and grab a beignet was a huge plus! Other hotel perks: free drinks per guest, free bottled water in the room, 15% off our stay, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>chocolates and ginger snaps in the lobby</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>This hotel is</span> in the very heart of the French Quarter. It is new, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and has good facilities</span>. WiFi, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>breakfast</span>, and a very well equipped business centre <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>was free</span> (normally charged for at other hotels), so I felt like I had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>good value for money</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff were friendly and helpful</span>. As this hotel has only just opened, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>there were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>a few very small teething problems in the area of service</span>, but I am sure this will be sorted out in no time. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would definitely stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>3 couples - friends for 30+ years, vacationing together for the first time. The hotel was fabulous - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>rooms were clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and the beds were incredibly comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>pool area was lovely</span> and a wonderful way to end the evening. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location - perfect walking distance to everything</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff pleasant and professional</span>. My husband and I had been to the French Quarter 15 years earlier and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we begged our friends to share this experience</span> with us. Thank you for making this a most memorable experience for us.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is located less than one block off of Bourbon St in the heart of the French Quarter. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>service was outstanding</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>accommodations were clean</span> and comfortable. It was a pleasure to stop after a full day on the road, enjoy some hot food and relax. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>courtyard was</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>nice</span> and relaxing. Everyone from the front desk to the general manager made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Well done!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Beautifully remodeled hotel in</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>the perfect location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>Very clean</span> and very quiet - unbelieveable since it's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>only 1/2 block off Bourbon Street.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was excellent</span>, the bar was a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>nice quiet retreat</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>courtyard is charming</span>. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>will definitely stay here again</span> on our next trip to NOLA!</div><div class='text-box'>Our room was very nice, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>service was excellent</span>. We felt like this was a real bargain, especially regarding the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>location in the center of "the quarter</span>", yet it was easy to find. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was clean</span> and well arranged. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Valet parking is really required</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Super breakfast included in price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Great convenient location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>Hotel was clean</span>-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>service outstanding</span>. Maybe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>need a little help retreiving car</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Really recommended to anyone.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This well-maintained hotel has good facilities, upscale but cozy vibe, and lovely courtyard and pool.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel sits in a perfect location and in walking distance to all the key landmarks.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are clean and the bed is super comfortable.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The only issue was the shower in the bathroom, which would spray outside the stall.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The service was outstanding in general; the staff here at this hotel are both helpful as well as professional.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">But there were some small teething problems , for example the housekeeping staff don't work after midnight.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel offered really chocolates and gingersnaps in the lobby and free breakfast.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Lovely pool area.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The valet parking should be provided.</span></div></div>
