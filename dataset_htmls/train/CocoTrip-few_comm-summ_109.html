<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I have stayed here three times -all on business trips where the hotel was booked for me. In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware. The two lifts are small and infrequent, and so you may have to wait a long time - which is annoying if you are on the top floors. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is great</span> for seeing Barcelona <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>-you can reach most of the central sights by foot</span> -including the Gaudi cathedral. Very near to a metro line , which is also a bonus. Rooms are fine -just try to get one facing the courtyard at the back -the ones to the front can be noisy. Biggest disappointment was the breakfast -17 for a very poor selection - definitely not worth it. I didn`t bother after the first morning.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a really good deal on the rooms at this hotel and, therefore, it was worth what we paid for it. However, I would have been dissapointed if we had payed full price for this. We went in january which I know is not in season however, the terraces were closed and the pools were not open. They were also doing refurbishment works to one of the terraces, none of this was really communicated until you checked in. The room was a reasonable size as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. The bathrooms however, need some updating, they were tired and not in the best condition. Also be warned if you stay on the front of the hotel, the spanish like to beep their horns and this can be disturbing.</div><div class='text-box'>Second time in this hotel and kinda disappointed. Rooms are ok and it is a good value for money mainly due to the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great location on Paseig de Gracia,</span> but the service does not seem to care so much about their customers. They are physically present behind the desk, but it stops here. It seems that they are breathing boredom. If you go to Barcelona for a short weekend and do not plan to spend too much time at the hotel, it'll be alright. If not, i'm sure you can pick a better place where the service will show you a more positive and customer focused attitude.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel staff was very helpful, rooms very modern with everything that we could think of. It is a short walk away from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and a bit longer to la Sagrada Familia, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the location couldn't be better</span>! Within a couple of blocks it has many restaurants to chose from and can't forget to mention that it's in a great shopping area. From now on the place where we'll stay when visiting Barcelona.</div><div class='text-box'>Great hotel! i can only think of a few things wrong with our stay, for one, breakfast was not worth the price paid and room service was a bit overpriced as well, but with such a wide variety of other places to eat in barcelona, it didn{t really mattter much. The standard room was small but then again the bed was huge! and the location. it can't get eny better!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is located in a great location</span> however is very expensive. If your looking for a place <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>near Gaudi's buildings and shopping areas</span>, then stay here.</div><div class='text-box'>A lovely pillow menu.WOW.rooms <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>excellent.location is very central and many many shops near the hotel</span>, staff very helpful. A bit pricey but Lovely</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great</span> place and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location</span>. Would defo stay here again. Loved it. Go see it.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located in a useful area to reach the central sights.</span></div></div>
