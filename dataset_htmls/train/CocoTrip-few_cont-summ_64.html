<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 5 day visit to Amsterdam. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is very good, being right next to Central Station</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>can be a little far from some of the tourist spots</span> such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and staff very polite. However, on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned</span>, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The towels that we were promised immediately</span> upon complaining <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>turned up over 2 hours later</span>. At no point were we offered anything to appease us, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff</span> simply apologised and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>were</span> ineffectual, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>polite</span>. This was disappointing, as apart from this, the stay was extremely pleasant.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the mint hotel/ doubletree by hilton. All I can say is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms were suberb</span>. Very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>friendly staff</span> at reception and breakfast was a delight. Unfortunately, room service needs to improve as our expectations were not managed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Food took longer to arrive</span> and had to keep chasing. Also we were told that the kitchen is closed after 45mins of putting our order. However, the rooms and freindliness of the reception/ breakfast team make up for it. Extremely good value for money and will stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>Just back from a short trip to the doubletree for my husbands 30th birthday, what a lovely hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Staff were friendly and helpful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>modern and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>clean</span>, also plenty of choice at breakfast time. We visited <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the sky lounge on the 11th floor</span>, it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>had a nice chilled atmosphere</span> but we only had one <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>drink there</span> as it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>was VERY expensive</span>! All in all great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel in great location</span>, would not hesitate in staying there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Amsderdam Mint as had previously stayed at the Leeds Mint & enjoyed the experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The Staff were very helpful & friendly</span>, had made a note on booking form was our Wedding Anniversary + my birthday received a bottle of wine in room, also complimentary Continental breakfast each day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel very central</span>, more hotels being built nearby so maybe some disruption? Although we didn`t have any problems.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights for the football at Ajax <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel is in a great location for the train station</span> and the Metro which you can take direct to the stadium, hotel even sells metro tickets. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>room was great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Apple tv is fantastic</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>bed is the most comfortable</span> i have ever had whilst staying away. staff all very helpful, will definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>This is an excellent hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>central for everywhere</span> in Amsterdam <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rooms are lovely</span>, but even with an upgrade they are still small. Lovely White Company toiletries. We had a lovely view and the balcony is a bonus. Breakfast is fantastic. You wont need to eat till teatime. Will def re-visit.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in this hotel for a weekend break and was very impressed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is lovely</span>, very stylish <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>fantastic views</span> (we had a room on the 7th floor). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is ideal</span> - only minutes from town.</div><div class='text-box'>Awesome <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel next to Central Station</span>? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Must eat at sky lounge at top of hotel</span>. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>over looks the</span> entire <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>city</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Perfect location to all tourist attractions</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is superbly located near the train station and there is a great view from the hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Additionally there are good tourist attractions nearby.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel room was just right.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The beds are very comfortable and the provision of Apple TV is a nice bonus.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Please note that on some occasions the room was not cleaned despite asking for that.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Staff are polite at all times.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The drinks here at this hotel are really expensive, but the sky-lounge at the very top of the hotel is really good and a must-eat.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">However food at this hotel did take a long time to come out.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Unfortunately the towels took a long time to come to the room.</span></div></div>
