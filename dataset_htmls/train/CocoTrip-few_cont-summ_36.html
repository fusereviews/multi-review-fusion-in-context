<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>this was a great place to stay for the two of us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel decor was fun</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staff were quite accomodating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There isalso a small restaraunt in this hotel that had great food</span> However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>for us it was located a bit off course in the sense that is is not subway convenient</span>. Further, because <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this is an old historic hotel</span>, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>As the elevator is original to the hotel, it must be staff operated</span>. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this. Our other choice was walking 3 flights of stairs.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the Gladstone this June for 7 nights. Its a great hotel and represents great value <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>in a really interesting area of the city</span>. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character.although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The downstairs cafe serves great food</span>, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The staff were very helpful and friendly</span> and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.</div><div class='text-box'>The Gladstone Hotel is a great place in Toronto for so many reasons, aside from being a hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>They have created unique spaces</span> for musicians, artists, foodies and families.to showcase, perform and indulge. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>They support and promote local and organic eating ( by the way they have a FRY BAR.sweet potato, potato and taro too</span> with tons of toppings). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Harvest Wednesdays supporting field to table eating</span> (yum) are not to be missed.and while you are there, you'll know why you need to try the Gladstone.</div><div class='text-box'>I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed. I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Gladstone is clearly more interested in being an arts/cafe/performance/bar venue for hipsters than a hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Details don't get addressed</span>, the rooms are crazy small, and it's just not comfortable for any extended stay. I will try The Drake next time.</div><div class='text-box'>Fantastic hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>great</span> drinks, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>food</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staff super nice</span> and cool. only complaints were that our left over margarita glasses weren't cleaned up, mattress wasn't great as it sagged in the middle and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the shower felt like we were washing in a horizontal MRI machine</span>! Opted not to say anything as we were only there for a couple of nights though would probably stay at the Drake Hotel next time we take a trip.</div><div class='text-box'>After a long flight <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we found reception to be slightly frosty and unfriendly</span>. You need the opposite after a long trip. The room was also slightly disappointing. We found it to be small and the design a bit half hearted with a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very strange shower</span>! It's beautiful old building but could do with a bit of warmth and character. Having stayed elsewhere in Toronto I'd recomend the hotel a couple of blocks east.</div><div class='text-box'>No 'Big City Attitude' here! The Gladstone had really <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>friendly and engaging staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Rooms were unique and fun.no cookie cutter boxes</span> with the same old crap. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Great food</span>, music and decor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>location are killer</span>. Lots to do around the hotel. Try it out if you want something different!</div><div class='text-box'>The Gladstone is a great escape in the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>It is well located to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hang out on Queen St West as well as</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the theatre district and more mainstream shopping</span>, and has much more charm than most hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Overall the rooms are interesting and fun</span>, but the beds are the best part.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Overall the hotel is a really unique place to stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location is pretty good but doesn't have great access to a subway line.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There's mainstream shopping and the theatre quarters close-by though which adds to how good the location is.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The shower in the room was very modern.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Most of the staff were friendly to guests.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">This hotel has a small restaurant that provides superb food that very proudly uses local and organic produce.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has an archaic elevator which is a novelty.</span></div></div>
