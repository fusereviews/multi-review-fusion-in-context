<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This place can be summed up in one word . flawless ! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Located across the street from</span> the most beautiful beach in Key West - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Smathers Beach</span> and literally 1.7 miles from Duval street it is prefect! The service was fantastic, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the grounds are very well kept</span>, with a cool pool. and the piece de Resistance . the room - comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>huge</span>, it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>literally the size of a small apartment</span>, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a small kitchenette, a dining table a huge couch and and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>super comfortable bed</span>, oh yeah and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the bathroom is also pretty darn big</span>. We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Since we brought our bikes, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel</span>. don't own a bike? Or don't feel like shipping them down with you ? No problem, the hotel has plenty of bikes for rent as well.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel has a great location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>across from the beach</span> and away from Duval street, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>a</span> free <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>shuttle</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>every hour</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>into town</span> and airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>Rooms are all suites</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>large</span> and comfortable <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>with microwave and wet bars, living room areas , well designed space with pocket doors</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to close off the bedroom for privacy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Comfortable beds</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nice vanity area,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>lots of storage space</span>. We were a large group and treated very well. The restaurant staff was particularly accomodating. As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem. Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Restaurant closed at 9</span> and bar at 11pm, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>a little early for our crowd</span> and Key West but that is my only complaint.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>The hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was decorated beautifully</span> for X-mas and I loved the Palm trees with Christmas lights! The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rate was what is to be expected for Key West, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>right by the airport</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The beach is across the street from the hotel</span> with multiple activities for one to participate in. Since the hotel is out of the was a smidge, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>they offer shuttles, numerous shuttles to all the hot spots</span> in Key West. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beautiful</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>very clean, unless you looked directly behind the toilet, which could use a little extra scrubbing</span>. I would stay here again, tomorrow!</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is an all suite hotel so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the rooms were very spacious</span> and allowed us to kick back in our room mid afternoons and mornings. If you like a slower pace and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a public beach across the street</span>, this is a good place to stay. You will have to drive or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>take the shuttle to Duval Street area</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the shuttle is only once an hour</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>Parking in the Duval Street area will cost from $10 to $35 per day</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I took my girlfriend here for a long weekend and to propose. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was</span> great, obviously, it wasn't a St Regis or even a Westin, but it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was very nice</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very functional</span> and enjoyable. The food and services were VERY expensive. I thought they took care of us well even though we were staying on points for free.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5 8'>This</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5 6 8 9'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 8 9'>has</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 8'>huge</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>rooms</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>bathrooms</span> and is in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>great location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>across from the beach</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>close to the airport</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Great food in the restaurant</span> and staff is wonderful! I highly recommend to anyone needing some extra space and doesnt care about being downtown!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Large</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>modern</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6 7'>rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>across from one of the few beaches in Key West</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>While far from downtown</span>, this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>offers</span> a lot of comfort, a nice little pool, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>regular shuttle service</span>. We would stay there again!</div><div class='text-box'>We went to enjoy Key West and our daughters were so excited and this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>motel was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 10'>a complete disappointment</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>Dirty</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>unsafe</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>only thing really redone was the lobby</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 10'>Elevators were very scary</span>, our daughters would not even ride without us.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is well maintained, functional and the decor is good.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has a public beach, Smathers Beach, across the road.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Duval Street and downtown is only an hour away</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">and you can take the shuttle there too.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">every hour.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is also close to the airport, If you own a bicycle it is a great location too.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">They were comfortable beds in a spacious room .</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Lots of storage available and a modern and clean environment.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">A large bathroom in the room too.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provided excellent food but the restaurant closes at 9pm which may be a little early for some tourists.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">The only complaint would be that the elevators are scary.</span> <span id="11" class="summary-sentence">Parking on Duval Street ranges between $10 and $35 per day but the hotel has bikes to rent so parking costs can be lessened or avoided.</span></div></div>
