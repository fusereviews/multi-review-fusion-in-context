<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Other reviews already pointed out some of the unusual features of this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel</span>, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>is located on the quiet water front</span> close to the cruise ship terminal, an ideal location for an overnight stay before and after the cruise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>The staff was friendly</span> & helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Internet in the room was free and worked without any problem</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>The restaurant</span> downstairs, with a good choice of wine by the glass, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>served tasty but pricey meals</span>. However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>there are several restaurants, grocery stores and deli shops in the neighbourhood frequented by the locals</span>. One fish shop in the mall down the street, with a long queue at lunch hour, served a variety of seafood take-outs at reasonable prices, and the herring I tried that day was probably as good as it can be. For those who are health conscious, a morning stroll/jog along the water front would definitely help to kick off the day in the right mood.</div><div class='text-box'>Firstly the good thing about the hotel is cultural and clean, but it doesn't really feel much like a hotel, instead, a B&B. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The overall service is just fair</span>, we booked it in advance through zuji, but when we arrived, they had no record and we need to wait for an hour for checking in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='12'>In the first day out, we left the wallets inside a luggage which is locked. Of course it may be not wise to do it, but it was too late when we found 300 euro was gone when we back while everything seems fine in the appearance. Probably it was stolen by the clean-up staff.</span> We were very disappointed with this hotel and would not recommend to travelers.</div><div class='text-box'>This is an unusual hotel, different from the normal run of the mill. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I had a large and comfortable room</span>, minimalist design which actually turned out to be quite relaxing! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Its a few stops on the tram from the city</span>, the road is reasonably quiet. The tram stop is close by, as is the canal hopper service. If you like design, or want to try something different then this might be for you.</div><div class='text-box'>I was there for 4 days. So all i have to say is that all we got <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were damaged walls and floors</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the rooms are very manky</span>. The toilets and showers were separately, but they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>were usually too dirty</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The service often forget to finish</span> their work. Only <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the location was good, there is a tram</span> directly to the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>near Central Train Station</span></div><div class='text-box'>strengths: - nice <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>old building with history</span> (old prison) weaknesses: - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>too expensive</span> (very bad price performance) 150 a for a two star room ! - bad tv reception - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>rooms looks like hospital/prison</span> - old towels - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9 10'>lousy unfriendly service</span> - addtional extra fees: parking 22 a, touristfee 7 a, breakfast17 a - to far form the center - noisy</div><div class='text-box'>I did enjoy the stay, I will list the pros and the cons Pro -nice price <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>-close to the trams</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>-helpful staff</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11'>-sweet to be able to order food in the middle of the night</span> (it was possible in the hotel) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>-cool rooms</span> cons -It was to far away from the city center to be able to walk.</div><div class='text-box'>The concept of having 1* to 5* <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>rooms is great</span>. Translation is another thing though because the service does not span that range. Definitely quirky <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>rooms</span> but many <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>have an open toilet</span>, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>is fine if you are single occupant</span>. Restaurant not great.</div><div class='text-box'>I return from a weekend at the LLOYD hotel, it is a very good hotel, not useull, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9 10'>stuff are very freindly</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>room very nice</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>(2 stars)</span> I would come back again and again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is in an old building.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The walls and floors were damaged but it was still nice.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's location is close to the tram line and train station which can take you into the city.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">There are many restaurants and grocery stores and delis to visit if you want to see some of the local life.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The waterfront is also close by for a walk or run.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel are okay.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Free Wi-Fi is on offer, and they are large and very comfortable.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The main issue with these rooms is that they have an open toilet, which isn't idea when there is more than one person occupying a room.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">They could also do with being cleaned more regularly as they are quite dirty.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The service is to an average standard.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">Staff are not always friendly and there can be a language barrier.</span> <span id="11" class="summary-sentence">The restaurant at this hotel serves reasonable food, however it can be quite expensive.</span> <span id="12" class="summary-sentence">Thievery occurred from locked luggage.</span></div></div>
