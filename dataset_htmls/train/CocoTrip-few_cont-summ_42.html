<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed here during Mardi Gras and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>couldnt ask for a better location</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in</span>. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room is equipped with a small kitchen</span> which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it's a good base to explore New Orleans</span> with the trolley right outside your door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter.probably 30 minutes</span> to 40 minutes. The rooms could be updated, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the staff was very helpful</span> even during the stressful Mardi Gras time (super busy for them) It also had a very spacious and updated gym to burn those calories off from <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>all the good food you eat in New Orleans</span></div><div class='text-box'>From the time we stepped out of our car to hand over our keys to the time we left <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>we were treated like royalty</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The porters</span>, Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>made us feel most welcome</span> especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a studio with a</span> king bed and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>full kitchen</span>, dressing area and shower. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>All were very clean</span>. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The Resort is in a residential area right on the St. Charles trolley line</span>. We purchased a Jazzy Pass at Walgreens down the street and never needed our car.</div><div class='text-box'>My daughter and I spend a weekend here while job hunting, school interviewing and house hunting. This was the perfect home base for all of our explorations. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>outside of the Quarter</span>. It was wonderful! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was amazing, so very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were spacious</span> and well appointed, the beds very comfortable and everything upgraded and modern. Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would recommend this to anyone</span> visiting this amazing city!</div><div class='text-box'>WOW - looking via the internet I was looking forward to staying at the Avenue Plaza. Too bad there was no information about them being timeshares. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is great - right on the St. Charles streetcar line</span>. But we didn't get fresh towels, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the beds were not made up, the floors were dirty</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>NOT what you want to see when you are traveling, especially when you know there are so many hotels in NO that are way classier</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would not recommend staying here at all</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room</span> was nicely appointed, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with a refrigerator, stove</span>, and coffee pot. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bathroom was small</span>, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 6'>Great location for</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>bar/</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 6'>restaurant hopping</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>on St Charles</span>, nice and clean pool, fantastic steak house on site! Fun 24/7 bar next door for karaoke. Loved my stay for my birthday. Walk down to the Blind Pelican for drinks, 15$ taxi to quarter, great shopping on Magazine st.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff were very friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>large and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>well appointed with</span> tv, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>kitchenette</span>, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Great shower</span>. Even though this is a timeshare there was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>no pressure to buy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>All staff went out of there way to be helpful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a wonderful place to stay</span> in a beautiful section of New Orleans. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Fine dining</span> and transportation all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>within walking distance</span>. Well worth the money, I will stay here again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Some would recommend the hotel to others, although some may not.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideally situated for transportation routes like the St. Charles line but also in walking distance of the Garden District and a bit further to the French Quarter.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has spacious rooms equipped with a kitchen.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very clean but the bathrooms are rather small.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The shower was excellent.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful , particularly the welcoming porters.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There is lots of great tasting food available to eat around this hotel.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides wristbands for entry into the premises which is a pleasing security feature.</span></div></div>
