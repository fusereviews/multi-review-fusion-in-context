<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I read many negative reviews after I made a non-refundable reservation for two nights. SO.I took all the negative comments to heart and when I checked in, I specifically asked for a refurbished, quiet room. Supposedly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>there are some rooms with antiquated furniture</span> and lots of noise, I waited a few hours to check in, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the room was very nice, small</span>, but nice flat screen tv, modern furniture, comfortable king-size bed and no noise even though we were near the elevator. I also got a coupon for free appetizer and $50 food and beverage credit. Everything in the hotel is expensive and Canada has a ton of tax on everything but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the food was good</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the place is gorgeous</span> but be aware, parking was $42 a night. Absurd.</div><div class='text-box'>This review is a little late I know, however we have beeen constantly travelling since our stay in early Sept. I note all the other reviews regarding dated property and poor hotel standards and I also note the constant apologies from Hotel Management, however with so many poor reviews why don't they fix the problems, then they wouldn't have to keep apologing. I won't repeat all the comments from so many poor reviews other than so say, that was our experience as well. For the price, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>poor hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>poor value for money</span>, there are better options in Toronto.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at Royal York for 3 nights at start of a trans Canada tour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The lobby etc. of the hotel are very grand</span> and imposing and well worth seeing, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Our room was the smallest</span> one of any of the hotels we stayed at during trip, although it had the normal two large beds, there was not a lot of room around them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Dark furniture and small window did not add to the rooms appearance</span>. Having said this we enjoyed our time here but if we ever return to Toronto will try somewhere else.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed one night because of the hotel's convenient Porter Airline shuttle available outside the hotel's door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff was attentive and helpful</span>, however the lines for the Concierge were long. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Lovely restaurants in the hotel</span> and there is an underground mall under the hotel. The hotel is a little expensive and parking is very expensive but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location is terrific</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rooms are small but comfortable</span>. Hotel is large and hallways are very long. Only complaint, typical of expensive hotels, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>you must pay $16 for internet access</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Located in heart of downtown near financial district and train station. Historic <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel with</span> grand lobby and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>lots of atmosphere</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Rooms small but clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and comfortable</span>. Service good, excellent concierge. Can be pricey, try to get a deal online, worth about 150 to 250 per night depending on time of year and size of room you get.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel on 9th Aug for three nights<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>.It is superbly located in the tourist area of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived in the hotel</span>.We stayed on the gold floor with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast included</span> this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was outstanding</span> we would highly recommend this hotel for a truly fantastic first class hotel in Torronto.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>An upgrade to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>an enormous suite</span>, fresh fruit and workout clothes waiting for me, 5pm check out, free shuttle to city airport. Very Royal indeed!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The service was impecabble</span>! But the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The rooms are very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>small and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>DIRTY</span>. You can see <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>dust everywhere</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had lots of atmosphere and made guests feel special.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Good location near the Toronto tourist spots.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the hotel are quite small but adequate.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Some of the rooms are dark and a little dirty, with antiquated furniture too.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The restaurants have some really nice food here at the hotel.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">One thing to note about the hotel is that you need to pay for access to internet services.</span></div></div>
