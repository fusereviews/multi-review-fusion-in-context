<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel was nice</span>. Recently remodeled. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff very friendly</span>. Convenient to Termini (helpful hint- take first side exit from the terminal if you come in on the train from the airport- cuts walk in half). We had 8 (4 couples) in our group- so we were able to get a shuttle cheaper than taking the train from the airport- cost us 78 euro total. Enjoyed the stay here- close to metro stops- nice grocery at the end of the street. We would get wine, snacks, cheese, etc. at the grocery and then have our own personal happy hour on the covered patio every night- it rained two nights, but we were still dry and comfy to discuss our day and the plans for the next day. Breakfast Buffet is normal Italian- good cappucino machine!</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel was close to the train station. We knew there was no bar be read that the patio was great for a bottle of wine and snacks. Which it was. It was clean and tidy, The value was great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Guanluca welcomed us to the hotel and was absolutely wonderful. helpfull, kind and full of information. The weekend staff were not so helpful and we ended up helping new guests that came in</span>. Breakfast was basic but great, you could eat as much as you like. We had rooms on the ground floor near reception and was a little noisy at times. Especially one night when the hoover was being used at 3am. Would I stay here again, YES. But would ask for rooms higher in the hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent two nights in Rome at Hotel Roma and were thrilled with the experience. It's relatively close to the train station and at first glance after dark <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the neighborhood looked a bit rough</span>. We were happy to find that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>despite our first impression we felt very safe walking after dark</span> to a restaurant few blocks away. The metro line is nearby and we were able to quickly get to all of the sites we wanted to see that way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel itself is lovely. Everything was clean</span> and comfortable, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful</span>. They definitely went above and beyond to meet our needs. We would not hesitate to recommend Hotel Best Roma.</div><div class='text-box'>there is a terrific market across the street from the hotel to pick up cheeses, fruits and yogurt, etc . to keep in the room.breakfast was the same each morning and we did stay six nights.a must is the gelato store two blocks away, however, not on a Sunday night being the wait is over and hour it seemed to be a family night .the best treat after touring all day to sit down and enjoy.the hotel was easy to get around Rome from.the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>front desk helpful</span> and our room was kept very clean.being we were there for a number of nights we would have enjoyed putting on the t.v. and having english sub titles or a cnn chanel to view.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at Best Roma in October and have to say that it was wonderful. The location was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>ideal for walking to the main sites</span> and with easy access to the Metro and train station and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>although other reviews had made us wary of the neighbourhood, we found it to be nothing but ideal</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel itself and our room were very well presented</span> and breakfast was to a high standard. The best thing about staying at this hotel though was undoubtedly the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff</span> who <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were</span> clearly hard working, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>always pleasant and very helpful</span> to us in getting around Rome and fully enjoying our holiday. We would most definitely stay here again and recommend it without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>The room was small, but in excellent condition with a new bathroom and very comfortable bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The front desk staff were excellent</span> and the breakfast of pastries, meats, eggs, breads and good coffee included gets you started in the morning. It is a 20 minute downhill walk to the Colosseum ( 25 mins back uphill!), 5 mins to metro, 15 mins to Termini station, 12 minutesto Top Bike tours, and whilst its on the far side of the city its easy to get around and see the sites. We got a good deal on the room and were reall impressed. We would stay here again at full price.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is near the Train Station (Termini). The metro is located some 600 meters away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The neighborhood is weird and seems a little dangerous</span>, we saw anyhing, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it is good to be aware</span>. The room decor is very beautiful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It's very clean and well maintained</span>. The Breakfast does not have much option but it is good and honest. Probably a forthcoming visit to Rome we will be in Best Rome Hotel. Recommend to friends. Also there is no free wireless.</div><div class='text-box'>We arrived in Hotel Best Roma fresh from Australia, our first European trip. It was an easy walk from the train station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel was very clean</span> and easily located to the metro. It is close walking distance to all major attractions (except the Vatican is further away) and so easy to get around. Bathroom was very small but that's the worst criticism I can give.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel itself is nice and clean, staffs are very friendly and helpful.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">However, the area around the hotel is not that safe.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It is safe to walk around the hotel in the morning, but will definitely not recommend to walk back to the hotel at night.</span></div></div>
