<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt - had a nice room (paid for an upgraded water view, which was nice to have), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff was friendly and helpful</span>, the location is perfect and we had a very decent rate. The lobbies were pretty nice, but we didn't hang out there or eat at any of the places. We walked most places (or took a cab if our destination was really far), even in the middle of winter. I try not to be too picky about these things, but our room was dusty the whole time we were there. It was enough to be noticed, so it should have been cleaned by the staff. Also, we weren't very fond of the bed. It was a bit on the hard side and wasn't exactly plus. It wasn't horrible though. Again, not horrible, but our room was very hot no matter how we set the temp at.</div><div class='text-box'>Overall the hotel is ok, very busy and noisy. Valet parking is the only choice you have and an additional $50 for every 24 hours. Valet parking stole our Ipod so they told us to fill out a claims report which we did and then we had to wait more than a week to call the claims department because the one and only person they have working claims was on vacation. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Once I was able to talk to the claims department she was no help at all</span>. She basically called me a liar and we will not be getting reimbursed for the loss of our IPod. I am furious that it cost me $50 per day extra and then we will have to pay another $250 + to replace our IPod.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here for two nights to partake in the Chicago St. Patricks festivities. Check in went super fast, and we were given a room the was so newly remodeled you could still catch a whiff of the fresh paint. It overlooked the river, which made for some great shots when they dyed it! Also, they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>allowed us a late check out</span> of 2pm, at no charge, in order to not miss the parade. The beds were amazing, as was the bathroom. Plenty of space, with a very nice desk set up. And being one block from Michigan, and a 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, this is a great location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency. I really don't think there is a better location in downtown. So conveniently located off the river and a short jaunt to Michigan Ave, Grant Park, and Navy Pier. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I have already recommended this hotel to other travelers</span> heading to Chicago. I would say, however, the dining in the hotel is pretty pricey. So, if you are looking to save a few bucks get outside of the four walls of the hotel. That being said, I will still always stay at this hotel when traveling to Chicago, with out a doubt.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed two nights on business. The location was great and the room was very nice. The price was $25-$30 cheaper than any comparable hotels in the area. I had two minor complaints. The closet door was off the track, and wouldn't open when I checked in, and they didn't fix it the second day. Also, the Big Bar closed early, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the bartender was not very polite about letting me know before last call</span>. Other than that, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend the place</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>As a hotel, it's very nice, with very nice amenitiies, but it's also expensive. Canned soft drink in the mini-bar cost $4.25, and Internet use in the business center was something like $10 for 7 minutes (or was that $7 for 10 minutes?). Location is good. If price is no object, it's a good choice, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>there are better bargains in the area</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The Hyatt is recently remodeled and very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was</span> extremely friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>always helpful</span>. The location is centrally located on the mag mile and we could easily walk to all there was to do downtown. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Will definitely stay here again</span>. Classy but not stuffy.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed there Feb 2005. A former jewel that has fallen into disrepair. The hotel is dark, and shabby. Even the newer wing is not up to par. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you stay in the Loop area, try the Burham instead</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff were helpful and would definitely stay at the hotel again.</span></div></div>
