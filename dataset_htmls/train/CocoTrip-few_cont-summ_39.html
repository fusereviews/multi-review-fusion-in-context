<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I visited Toronto end of May and stayed in this hotel with a colleague. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is situated in the city centre of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>rooms in the hotel were cleaned</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and spacious</span>. The bedding was very nice; the bathroom was modern with marble unit top and the toiletries were of good quality. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The corridor had also an ice machine</span> which I thought was very good idea, for those who like their cold water any time of the day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast in the hotel was also good, with a good choice of food</span>. Newspapers were delivered to you in the morning and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staffs were very pleasant and helpful</span>. The hotel also had a bar with a dancing floor and this was quite handy for us as we could drink and dance in. I will go there again if I ever go to Toronto and will definitely recommend it.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and had a fantastic time. The hotel is very nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staff are very helpful and friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Our room</span> was on the 8th floor and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was a very good size</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathroom was spacious</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We had breakfast in the Market Garden, it was great with a very good choice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I found the hotel to be very quiet even although it is a very busy hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location of this hotel is great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is a 2 minute walk to the Eaton Centre (which is great) and about 20 -25 minute walk down to Front Street for the CN Tower</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at the Delta Chelsea in Toronto many many times over the past years and have never been disappointed. The quality of this hotel is second to none and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location is perfect. close to everything "downtown"</span>. as well as transit . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are well kept, clean</span>. and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the beds are incredibly comfortable</span>. If I have one negative comment regarding this hotel it would be that the restaurant is very expensive. I find myself going out to eat meals while staying at the Delta Chelsea. All in all. I always enjoy my stay at this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I visited TO for my birthday. The Delta Chelsea <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>prestige clerk didnt have any interest in doing something special for my birthday</span> (Montreal Delta Centerville are more then happy to give wonderful experience for celebrations!) Even though it was written on my reservation I was there for my bday; I had to verbally remind them and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>they didnt seem too interested</span>. Got a few balloons and 2 chocolate strawberries. Woohoo! In the morning I finally got them to give me free breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rm was clean</span> and for most part comfortable</div><div class='text-box'>enjoyed a week for business, especially enjoyed the spa next door Elmwood Spa - they give a discount if show your room key. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the curry's at lunch time in the bistro are great as is the affordable food in the cafe part</span>. Pub i didn't like too much . but the restaurant is excellent. business services are really good - make sure you get an upgraded room and that been renovated as some are looking rather tired. great staff, very friendly</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was small and</span> definitely in need of a makeover. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bathroom was very small</span> and very much in need of a makeover. I am sure both were clean, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>they</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>did not seem to be clean because they are so dingy</span>. At $300 for one night, I was grossly over charged.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for the weekend of November 4-6. Got a last minute deal and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>was happy with the location</span>. There is some construction nearby so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>be warned of the noise</span> in the early morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Close to all amenities</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Enjoyed the Delta experience</span>, will definately come back. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>retaurant staff were outstanding, epecially the chef</span> on duty.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Despite being quite a busy hotel it was really quiet.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel is perfectly situated for exploring downtown as well as good for a medium-length walk to other attractions and sights.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel rooms were spacious and clean.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The bathrooms were large and the room had really good bedding.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The staff here at this hotel seemed a little bit uninterested but the housekeeping staff did do a really good job cleaning.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had a good choice of food with a lovely breakfast and good curry lunches.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has an ice machine available for guests in the room corridors.</span></div></div>
