<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>really great hotel</span> My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Privilege for 3 nights - our first visit to Florence and we came as tourists for sightseeing in Italy. The hotel and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 5'>staff were exceptionally nice</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the hotel was good value for money</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were a good size</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>clean</span>, comfortable and with aircon (very necessary). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5'>The location is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>perfect</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>an easy walk to the centre</span>. The staff were extremely helpful and accomodating and helped us to arrange an onward travel itinerary and booked cars and hotels for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>They make an excellent breakfast here</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Would recommend this place</span> if you are looking for a good quality friendly 3 star hotel in a great location.</div><div class='text-box'>Wonderful small hotel on the Arno River. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Wonderful</span> small <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel</span> on the Arno River. The managers were very helpful and could tell you just where to go and what to see. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast was wonderful</span> and the service was too. The room we had on the water had a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>wonderful view of the river</span>, but it became a little warm for us with the windows and shutters closed since the AC was off (some guests thought it was getting cold, but wee from Alaska). We were moved to an interior room the next night and all was well since we could let a breeze blow through. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I would recommend this hotel to anyone in this price range</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent staff and lovely hotels Hi,We stayed in this hotel couple of weeks back and I must admit that it was wonderful.
