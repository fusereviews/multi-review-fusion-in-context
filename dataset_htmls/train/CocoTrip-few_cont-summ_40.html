<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I visited Toronto end of May and stayed in this hotel with a colleague. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is situated in the city centre of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms in the hotel were</span> cleaned and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>spacious</span>. The bedding was very nice; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathroom</span> was modern <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with marble unit top</span> and the toiletries were of good quality. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The corridor had also an ice machine which I thought was very good idea, for those who like their cold water any time of the day.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast in the hotel was also good, with a good choice of food</span>. Newspapers were delivered to you in the morning and the staffs were very pleasant and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel also had a bar with a dancing floor and this was quite handy for us as we could drink and dance in.</span> I will go there again if I ever go to Toronto and will definitely recommend it.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and had a fantastic time. The hotel is very nice and the staff are very helpful and friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room</span> was on the 8th floor and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was a very good size</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathroom was spacious</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We had breakfast in the Market Garden, it was great with a very good choice</span>. I found the hotel to be very quiet even although it is a very busy hotel. The location of this hotel is great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>It is a 2 minute walk to the Eaton Centre</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>(which is great)</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>and about 20 -25 minute walk down to Front Street for the CN Tower</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'></span></div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at the Delta Chelsea in Toronto many many times over the past years and have never been disappointed. The quality of this hotel is second to none and the location is perfect. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>close to everything "downtown</span>". as well as transit . The rooms are well kept, clean. and the beds are incredibly comfortable. If I have one negative comment regarding this hotel it would be that the restaurant is very expensive. I find myself going out to eat meals while staying at the Delta Chelsea. All in all. I always enjoy my stay at this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I visited TO for my birthday. The Delta Chelsea prestige clerk didnt have any interest in doing something special for my birthday (Montreal Delta Centerville are more then happy to give wonderful experience for celebrations!) Even though it was written on my reservation I was there for my bday; I had to verbally remind them and they didnt seem too interested. Got a few balloons and 2 chocolate strawberries. Woohoo! In the morning I finally <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>got them to give me free breakfast</span>. Rm was clean and for most part comfortable</div><div class='text-box'>enjoyed a week for business, especially enjoyed <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the spa next door Elmwood Spa - they give a discount if show your room key</span>. the curry's at lunch time in the bistro are great as is the affordable food in the cafe part. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Pub i didn't like too much</span> . but the restaurant is excellent. business services are really good - make sure you get an upgraded room and that been renovated as some are looking rather tired. great staff, very friendly</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small</span> and definitely in need of a makeover. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bathroom was very small</span> and very much in need of a makeover. I am sure both were clean, but they did not seem to be clean because they are so dingy. At $300 for one night, I was grossly over charged.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for the weekend of November 4-6. Got a last minute deal and was happy with the location. There is some construction nearby so be warned of the noise in the early morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Close to all amenities</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Enjoyed the Delta experience, will definately come back. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>retaurant staff were outstanding, epecially the chef</span> on duty.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A nice touch is that the spa next to the hotel give a discount if you provide them with proof of a hotel stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is close to all of the major downtown sights and travel in the centre of Toronto.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It is a short walk to the Eaton Centre and around 25 minutes' walk to the CN Tower.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room at this hotel was pretty big and featured a nice big bathroom with marble-top unit.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast here at the hotel is really good and varied for choice.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There was also a bar to drink and dance in, too.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There were ice machines in the corridor for guest use, which is great if you like your water cooled down.</span></div></div>
