<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. Great service, attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer - make it feel like coming home. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.</div><div class='text-box'>You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word "calm" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.</div><div class='text-box'>All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost. The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such a wonderful hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day</span>. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi. Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne. Thanks a lot, Achem!</div><div class='text-box'>Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Excellant service and staff</span>. Rooms are large and standard of cleanlines is very high. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was great, with a huge choice and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure.</div><div class='text-box'>We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff are very attentive</span>, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.</div><div class='text-box'>Fantastic hotel - wonderful rooms, great beds, fruit in the room every day, extensive gym.could not have asked for more. A few minutes walk from Orchard Road so when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close but far enough away to not hear the noise. The gym and LINE restaurant were WONDERFUL. I will definitely stay here again - perfect for my business trips to Singapore.</div><div class='text-box'>What a wonderful atmosphere and a great room for a great price. The breakfast buffet was out of this world. The room was gorgeous. Service was exceptional.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very friendly to guests.</span></div></div>
