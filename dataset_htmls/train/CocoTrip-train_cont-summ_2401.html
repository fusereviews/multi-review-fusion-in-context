<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel is a great family hotel. It has a lot for the family</span>. The restraunts are okay, the buffet is great, the shows are super fun. The indoor amusement park is really fun. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is a older hotel. It isnt as nice as the MGM but it is also 1/2 the price</span>. It is a little dirtier then some of the other hotels, but like I said, it is a family hotel. If you want something really nice, then pay for it and stay at MGM. If you want a clean room and beds, that is a fun hotel, lots to do, aand you dont mind it being a little older then this a great way to have a little more spending money.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Only stay at Circus Circus if you are bringing your children to Vegas with you</span>. If you are doing that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>it is a great place for them</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>If you</span> are like me, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>have no children this place was terrible</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>Kids screaming and running in the halls</span>. And the food was more catered to the family, and not very good at all. Granted I spent most of my time out of the hotel, but when I did come back, I really didn't want to be bothered by a bunch of little kids. You can spend about the same amount at Paris Paris and there are less kids there. The best buffet I had was at the Luxor.</div><div class='text-box'>We had no complaints about this hotel, for the price you pay.it is everything you need. We had a refurbished West Tower room and the room was as nice as a 4 star property, without the extra's like a fridge and minibar. I'm sure you can live without these when there are drinks available right downstairs! We found the hotel very clean, staff friendly and all the ammenties you could need. Fair enough, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it was bust with families</span>, but what do you expect with a hotel that has 3800 rooms? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>If you want quite</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> I don't think you should be in Vegas.or</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you need to be staying off the strip</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My partner and I stayed at Circus Circus as it was the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cheapest hotel</span> we could find in Vegas. It was our first stay there and we didnt know what to expect. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We booked Main Tower rooms which were modern and nice. A lot nicer than the rest of the hotel</span>. If your going for the first time and only need a hotel to sleep in then Circus is for you. If you want to relax and make use of the resorts then go some where else like MGM! Its really is what you make of it! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Dont expect super resort style</span>. But <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>worth the money</span></div><div class='text-box'>we found our stay here overall a bit disappointing. the rooms were nice and clean and big enough. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel itself is very outdated so you get what you pay for</span>. the food in the buffet was a big disappointment. and being at the end of the strip <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>its either start walking or hang around for the bus</span>. Thats why i say you do get what you pay for. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>If you've got a family on a budget then this is for you</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>if you want to be more central to the strip then this is not for you</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>If you want the ultimate tacky Vegas trip then this is the hotel for you</span>. This is an older hotel than most of them on the strip. The rooms were big and clean. The pool area could do with a lot of upgrading and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>unless you are with kids then Adventure Land is a bit disappointing</span>. I would say that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>this is about as far out on the strip as you would want to go</span> although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>there is a bus that runs up and down all the time</span> with a $5 fee all day.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The Circus Circus is located in the north part of the strip</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you do not need luxurious room but comfortable bedroom</span> like us, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel is suitable for you</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was clean and quiet if you leave the windows close</span> and if you are high enough in the tower, floor 7 or more. The hotel have a good and cheap buffet.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is</span> so big and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>so cheap that you shouldn't expect much</span>. The room was a little larger than most and mostly clean but the service was really horrible. It is also so far from the main strip that you need to plan a way to get around, which is easy to do. The pool is very pathetic.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">You only get what you pay for is very true - especially when it comes to this Hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It was very crowded with loads of screaming children - not the place if you want peace and quiet!</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Then if thats what you want you shouldn't be in Vegas!</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Had previoulsy stayed in the Imperial, which again is cheap and cheerful - but far supieror to Circus Circus.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Also staying in Excalibur, which is the best of the 3.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">This Hotel is great is you have children in tow - but avoid if you haven't.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">It is also a fair way from any other Hotel on the Strip</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">so if you dont like walking you will need the bus.</span></div></div>
