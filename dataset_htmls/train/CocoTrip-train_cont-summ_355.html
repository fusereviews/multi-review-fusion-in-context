<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Three of us stayed in the Embassy Hotel in April'05 and it was a great hotel. Excellent location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>just 10 minutes from the</span> main train <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>station</span>, very close to the main tourist attractions, including the zoo. Always felt safe walking to or from the hotel at anytime. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are</span> a fair size and are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span> and quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast is basic</span> but nice and will get you going and you can always find an excuse to go grab more food in any of the wonderful coffee shops around Rome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Staff were also very friendly and helpful</span> and we had no porblems leaving our bags with them on checkout so we could explore Rome further while waiting to go to the airport later in the day. A very satisfying trip and I would stay there again without hesitation.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is excellent, perfect service, great price. I stayed in different hotels during my tour in Italy, and this was superior to any other hotel. It is well located, within walking distance of the main railway station and sites such as the Trevi Fountain, it is across the road from a bus stop, and fairly easy to find. I was impressed with the welcome from one staff member who gave me useful information including a very useful free guide to tourist sites in Rome.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms were clean</span> and breakfast was quite good.Also the three restaurants just outside the hotel one directly in front and the two just down the side street on the left are excellent . I will definitely use this hotel again when I come back to Rome some other time.</div><div class='text-box'>Just returned from Rome where I spent 3nights at the Hotel Embassy in a triple room with my 2 daughters one 24 and the other 14. The hotel is situated in a street about 10minutes walk from the top of the Via Veneto and is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>in a building shared with other hotels and offices</span>. I found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the staff</span> to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>pleasant and helpful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>our room and bathroom were both clean</span> and modern with clean towels etc each day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast was a continental breakfast e.g yoghurt, juice, croissants, coffee etc</span> and was enough for us. I thought this was a good value hotel not too far from the main attractions of Rome and we never felt unsafe in the area at all.</div><div class='text-box'>I was in Rome for 5 days and stayed in Embassy hotel. This small hotel, was in harmony with Rome's atmosphere, sophisticated and simple. It is close to the centre of Rome so the access to all famous sites was easy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Room was</span> spacious and warm, the bed was of good quality. In general <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very well preserved and very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Staff was more than polite and eager to help</span> with all questions and necessary information to find our way through the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was</span> delicious and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>much more than "continental breakfast"</span> as described in their website. I truly enjoyed the stay in Embassy hotel and I strongly recommend this place.</div><div class='text-box'>We found this hotel to be central and clean, but were given the smallest room in the whole place (which was obvious from the fire floor plan on the back of the door) and could touch all 4 walls of the bathroom without moving ! We were very glad that we were without kids and that we were out almost the whole day and evening each night. Although not on a main road it is close to a main road junction which can cause quite a lot of traffic noise even at night. That said, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the breakfasts were efficient and sufficient</span>, and it was very clean so we were not disappointed in that respect.</div><div class='text-box'>My partner and I have just returned from a 5-night stay in Rome. The Embassy Hotel is well located and is within walking distance of the Piazza Republica and the Via Veneto in fact, we walked to the Colosseum and the Vatican. I would agree with other writers, in that the hotel is not luxurious but we did not go to Rome to spend a great deal of time in the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>This is a budget hotel, which is spotlessly clean</span> and relatively well located. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast was very basic</span> but edible.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at the hotel this past July and as the cab drove up I was a little skeptical considering the entrance is on a small side street and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>there are offices in other parts of the building</span>. The lobby was very small but everyone was very helpful. When I got to the room I was very impressed after staying in extremly small rooms for the same price in Paris, Marseille, and Venice. The room was spacious, had a nice TV, and AC a definite plus in the middle of summer.</div><div class='text-box'>we were disappointed with the size of the room and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the complementary breakfast left something to be desired</span>. but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the staff were very friendly and helpful</span>, which is rare in some of the budget hotels. i'd like to think you could get a better sized, better located room at this price, but at the end of the day we were fine with it.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was located in an old block of appartments with 2 other hotels.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel was in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor and in these floors there were also other offices.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The elevetor was extremely old with a metal web around it, like the one we see in old movies.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Our room was clean but the block of appartments in general was extremely dirty.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The toilet seat and the bin in the bathroom were broken and the shower sink was plugged.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The front door of the hotel was open all day and anyone could get in the building.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was limited to croissant.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">However, it was 5 minutes from the metro station and the personell of the hotel was friendly and helpful.</span></div></div>
