<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>It was the fault of my life selecting San Giusto Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>It was a central hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but that is all</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The elevator is not in the entrance you have to climb long stairs to reach it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room is very small</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>every door in the room</span> includes the door of the wardrobe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>does not function</span> well and noisy. The bath was terrific; toilet siphon was out of function, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the shower handle was broken</span>, not mounted on the wall, it was on the floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We warned the staff about the problems, nothing has changed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast includes nothing, it is disgusting</span>. While we were leaving the hotel, they demonstrated their real attitude to their clients, behaved very agressive. I recommend any hotel in Rome but not San Giusto.</div><div class='text-box'>Firstly the bad thing the directions we were given were not good, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>once off the metro it was more difficult to find than we were led to believe</span>, but this was only because <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the main entrance does not face the Piazza Bologna. Look for the Pizzeria Caffee and it is next door.</span> (But <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I wouldnt recommend using the Pizzeria Caffee</span>). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel was lovely and clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff were very pleasant and helpful</span>. It is ideally located next to the Metro so sore feet on the way home dont have far to go. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast wasnt brilliant</span> and we were not given any information on times etc, but for a quick snack in the morning before setting off it was fine. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here for several nights while on a tour of Italy. It is well situated in Rome, right near the subway station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There is great food just a short walk away</span>, in almost every direction you go. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was frequently cleaned</span>, and well maintained. One warning, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the elevator is only accessible from the second floor and up</span>, which means that you have to carry your luggage up a flight of stairs before you can reach it! That could be difficult for some people. There is a nice terrace on the 4th or 5th floor that has some outdoor seating, and there is also some space on the roof of the building (accessible via elevator). Overall, a decent place to stay.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>There is no way this is a 3 star hotel</span>. There wasn't even tissue or soap. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are very tiny</span> of course, the AC is ancient but did work. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>There are no plugs, they're so ancient you can't use them</span>. Rotary dial phone, you can't use. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The staff was friendly enough but not helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>or able</span> to put through a phone call. I would not stay here again, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the room was not dirty but it could have been a lot cleaner</span>. On the last night we switched to a hotel called Imperio located next to Termini station which is better and less expensive. We paid 75 euro per night there but San Giusto was about 125euro - RIP OFF!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the hotel from 23rd to 26th June We found and excellent deal trough leonardihotels.com, 80/night <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>double room</span> (king size bed,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span> and with airco), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>including a very good breakfast</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>It's true that you have to carry your luggage up to 1st floor</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but this was not a problem for us</span> with light bags. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Location is in a quiet area 30 minutes walking from Termini Station but there is a Metro</span> and Bus <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Stop around the corner</span>., actually the best way to move around Rome it is by bus(very cheap ;-) ), bus line 62 at the corner will take you to Fontana di Trevi in about 12 minutes, .The Only inconvenient is that bus service finishes at 24:00h</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hotel San Giusto this September. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The Hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is basic</span>, clean and perfect for doing Rome on a budget. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff are exceptionally friendly</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>even putting up with my terrible Italian</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Its close to a Metro Station which is a really convenient</span> and cheap way to travel around the city. (Weekly unlimited ticket is only 16 euro) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There is also a fantastic restaurant just around the corner</span>, and plenty of shops in the area. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are a little on the small side, but very well kept</span> and air conditioned. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, first class as long as you know what your getting.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This was not a good experience</span>! I had not chosen this hotel but was sent there due to an overbooking error at its sister hotel. The beds were uncomfortable but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bathroom was clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room</span> was at the front of the hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>which was soo noisy</span> (even throughout the night). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The lift only goes from the 1st floor so</span> a struggle to get luggage to the room and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>you still have to navigate stairs</span> all the way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was poor</span>. I would not recommend this as it certainly wasn't a budget hotel!</div><div class='text-box'>We found a good price through lastminute.com, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the location was excellent</span> for access by public transport (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the hotel is right at a Metro station, and on bus lines from major sites</span> including the Vatican). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was well-fitted out</span>. However, we found that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the shower water never got hot</span>, and there was an icy draft in the bathroom (it was winter). Another drawback is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>you must carry your luggage up one flight, before getting to the lift</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was ok but nothing special</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">It wasn't the worst of the hotels we stayed in (not by far) but it wasn't the best either.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The front desk staff was dismal, not rude but not personable either.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were tiny but clean.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">We had problems with the electricity going off and got rather used to showering and eating in the dark, romantic no!</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Although the hotel is not centrally located it is easy to find and close to the metro.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There are several restaurants within walking distance with good food at reasonable prices.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfasts were fresh and the service excellent.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Although there is an elevator it is only accessable after you climb a flight of stairs.</span></div></div>
