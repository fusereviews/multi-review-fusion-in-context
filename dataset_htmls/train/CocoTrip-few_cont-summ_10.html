<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>If you are looking for complete peace, beauty, and relaxation away from the crazy commercialism of Cancun, this is the place. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The resort is located only 45 minutes south of the Cancun airport</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the resort will arrange for transportation to and from the airport</span> for you. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and will go out of their way to assist you with whatever you may need. The property itself is very beautiful and landscaped throughout with lush gardens. It is as close to paradise as one can get. Mahekal is in walking distance of 5th Avenue (main strip for shopping, restaraunts, etc.) Mahekal has a wonderful wedding planner on staff who helped arrange everything for my wedding from the flowers to the hair dresser, photographer and priest. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The resort and beach</span> is beautiful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the food is outstanding</span>, the people are extremely friendly and welcoming, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the atmosphere is completely relaxing</span>. Without a doubt, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this is one of the most amazing experiences</span> I have ever had and am looking forward to going back again this year.and hopefully many more to come.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A most relaxing holiday spot.the</span> staff worked so hard to repair the hurricane damage,but in such a unobtrusive way that one's stay there was not impaired in the least.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The beach area</span> was always tidy,ample beds and shade,good service at all times and the room was directly facing the sand.blissful.I confess I didn't want to do anything but take to my sunbed,read,swim,bask and take refreshment.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I felt secure there at all times;there was always an attendant around even at night</span> but again without having a strong-arm presence.The hotel guests were obviously having a good time;the friendly approach of the dining attendants ensured this at meal-times.The towels in the rooms were "sculptured" into an array of animals,with a new piece of artwork appearing at every room service. And as a final touch.on the morning of our departure,we were given a breakfast box;this contained appetising food and drink. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.a credit to Mexico and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a jewel</span> in the Yucatan!</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I really enjoyed <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 6'>the Mahekal</span> - the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was very friendly</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>food was excellent</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms very comfortable</span>. This is a very low-key facility - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>rooms do not have TVs, radios or even clocks</span> - but the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>beds are comfortable</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>showers work well</span>. We stayed in the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Garden area</span> which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was quite nice</span> - and still only <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>a short walk to the beach</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Every room has a sheltered porch with two hammocks</span> and a table and chairs. The location is near (a couple of blocks away) from the main shopping street. The beach is well maintained. All-in-all, a very nice place and a good value. A few complaints - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>could use better internet accessibility</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>some of the hotels in the area have music blasting a bit too loudly at times</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>16 years and still coming back. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is such a fun</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>laid back</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>wonderfully relaxing place without a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>phone</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>in your room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>or a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>tv blaring</span> in your ear. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Kids around the pool</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>adults talking</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the sound of wind, waves, and yet it is quiet</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Excellent</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>food</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>you sit next to the ocean or inside comfort.it is not at all like an all inclusive</span>, thank goodness. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is specially unique</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Clean hotel rooms, large tiled bathrooms, fans and air conditioning make for excellent cabana-like rooms.
