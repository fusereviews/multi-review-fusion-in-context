<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in central Toronto and settled on 1 king west. My spouse and I stayed in a superior studio suite and were extremely satisfied with our stay. I was attracted initially to the non-cookie cutter rooms typical in most hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was very modern with sophisticated looking furnishings</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a very comfortable bed</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>nice walk-in shower and modern kitchenette</span>. We were stationed on the 18th floor and did find the room a bit dark as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>our bedroom window was frosted over as it clearly faced another building in close proximity</span>. We did not consider this an issue however because the room had so many other positives and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the 'office' section of the room offered a view of the lake</span>. My only disappointment was that there was no wi-fi (only hard-wired) so I was unable to use it.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>This hotel was spacious, quiet and very clean</span>. I would sum up the negative points of some other reviews by saying that this property is new and they are clearly still working on "opening" and getting their procedures in place. We had a glitch with our cards upon check-in and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the staff upgraded us</span> to a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>deluxe 2-room suite</span> on the 44th floor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with views on 3 sides</span>. We moved to this hotel after having a bad experience at the Cosmpolitan, which is right across the street. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>did not have any problems or costs involved with getting our car in and out</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>another cool benefit is that the concierge staff</span> has a fleet of vintage cars (Bentley, '60 Cadillac, Rolls) with drivers who will take you to various downtown sites for free (with an advance reservation).</div><div class='text-box'>I've stayed at this hotel several times on trips to Toronto. It is in a great location. Walking distance to Eaton Centre, restaurants and theatres. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Parking price is a little steep at 30$ a day</span> but will pay around that amount anywhere in T.O. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room came well equiped</span> - washer, dryer, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>kitchenette</span> and king bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Only negative in the room was the shower which tended to leak all over the bathroom floor and was so powerful it was an extremely uncomfortable experience.</span> This could be room-specific as I did not have this experience on my previous stays. Overall, for the price, this is a great place to stay in downtown T.O.</div><div class='text-box'>Fabulous few days in Toronto! Hotel is in a fab location to walk to the main shopping mall and the heart of Downtown. Hotel is very clean and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>staff were lovely, very helpful and pleasant</span> . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were very clean</span> and comfortable, and just right for a short city break, as we didn't spend much time in the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The parking in the hotel was very very expensive $30 per night</span>! We had a car for 4 nights so worked out very expensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Lovely breakfast though but again a little overpriced</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I'd read the reviews and felt confident we'd get value.and we did. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>A nice clean hotel</span> in a great location for site seeing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short break to take in Torontos sites. Very good. My only small gripe is I would have liked <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>bottled water</span> available in the room. You <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>need to buy your own</span> but that's a minor personal irritation. Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>everything seemed first rate <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>.until i had to deal with the concierge.i think her name was christine. maybe she should work by herself.she seemed upset</span> when my family requested reservations were asked to be made. but the rest of the property was outstanding. will stay again.just <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>wouldnt use the conceirge again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This was our third time staying at this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>What brings us back? Cleanliness</span>, location (max 10 minute walk to Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Union Station, Historic District), friendliness, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>quality of room</span>, and price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Also, the concierge is really helpful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great Hotel. I stayed for 3nights in early July with my husband and 2 teenage sons sharing 1 room. Plenty of space, 2 TVs, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Very clean</span>. Nice bar area. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Frendly staff</span> and good position. For the money it is hard to fault it.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel are very modern and have nice furnishings and the bed is very comfortable.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It came equipped with a good shower and kitchenette but the shower did spray and leak onto the floor.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Overall the rooms were clean and nice and the views were generally good.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff at this hotel are mostly lovely and friendly other than the concierge.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Very nice breakfast but a bit expensive.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Parking was very expensive at $30 a day.</span></div></div>
