<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I visited Toronto end of May and stayed in this hotel with a colleague. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is situated in the city centre of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms in the hotel were cleaned</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>spacious</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The bedding was very nice</span>; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the bathroom was modern with marble unit top and the toiletries were of good quality</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The corridor had also an ice machine which I thought was very good idea</span>, for those who like their cold water any time of the day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The breakfast in</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>the hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>was also good</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>with a good choice of food</span>. Newspapers were delivered to you in the morning and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the staffs were very pleasant and helpful</span>. The hotel also had a bar with a dancing floor and this was quite handy for us as we could drink and dance in. I will go there again if I ever go to Toronto and will definitely recommend it.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and had a fantastic time. The hotel is very nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the staff are very helpful and friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our room</span> was on the 8th floor and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was a very good size</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the bathroom was spacious</span>. We had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>in the Market Garden</span>, it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>was great with a very good choice</span>. I found the hotel to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very quiet even although it is a very busy hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The location of this hotel is great. It is a 2 minute walk to the Eaton Centre</span> (which is great) and about <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>20 -25 minute walk down to Front Street for the CN Tower</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at the Delta Chelsea <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>in Toronto</span> many many times over the past years and have never been disappointed. The quality of this hotel is second to none and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the location is perfect</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>close to everything "downtown</span>". as well as transit . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are well kept</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>. and the beds are incredibly comfortable. If I have one negative comment regarding this hotel it would be that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the restaurant is very expensive</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>I find myself going out to eat meals</span> while staying at the Delta Chelsea. All in all. I always enjoy my stay at this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I visited TO for my birthday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The Delta Chelsea prestige clerk didnt have any interest in doing something special for my birthday</span> (Montreal Delta Centerville are more then happy to give wonderful experience for celebrations!) Even though it was written on my reservation I was there for my bday; I had to verbally remind them and they didnt seem too interested. Got a few balloons and 2 chocolate strawberries. Woohoo! In the morning I finally got them to give me free breakfast. Rm was clean and for most part comfortable</div><div class='text-box'>enjoyed a week for business, especially enjoyed <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the spa next door Elmwood Spa - they give a discount if show your room key</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the curry's at lunch time in the bistro are great as is the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>affordable food in the cafe part</span>. Pub i didn't like too much . but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the restaurant is excellent</span>. business services are really good - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>make sure you get an upgraded room</span> and that been renovated as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>some are looking rather tired</span>. great staff, very friendly</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>small and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>definitely in need of a makeover</span>. The bathroom was very small and very much in need of a makeover. I am sure both were clean, but they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>did not seem to be clean because they are so dingy</span>. At $300 for one night, I was grossly over charged.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for the weekend of November 4-6. Got a last minute deal and was happy with the location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>There is some construction nearby</span> so be warned of the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>noise in the early morning</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Close to all amenities</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Enjoyed the Delta experience</span>, will definately come back. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The retaurant staff were outstanding</span>, epecially the chef on duty.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Tthe noise levels is surprisingly low for such a busy hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Although the restaurant can be expensive, there is a spa on site that also offers discounts to guests staying here.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel is perfect for those that want to be close to all amenities, as it based in the city centre of Toronto.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">It is also walking distance to many of the major attractions in this area which is ideal.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Rooms at this hotel are very spacious and cleaned to a high standard.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The amenities provided were of an excellent quality and the bedding in particular was very nice.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were not very interested in their guests.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The food at this hotel is of great quality, whether you're eating there during breakfast, lunch or dinner, and it is also affordable dining.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There is a great selection on offer for breakfast especially.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">There is an ice machine in the corridor which is good.</span></div></div>
