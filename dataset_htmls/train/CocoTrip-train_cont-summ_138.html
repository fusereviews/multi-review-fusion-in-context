The location was excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>Close to the train station and very close of all the main attractions</span>. We walked to visit this wonderful city and to eat in many very good restaurants close by the hotel. Our double <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>room was in front of a small park</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was very clean and roomy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel was very quiet</span> and the employees were very helpful. We arrived early but were able to let our luggage at the reception. The hotel was just 5 minutes fron a laundrymat which was very convenient. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Sole reservation is the breakfast which was ordinary</span>. (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>cappucinos and hot chocolate were great though</span>). One of the best deal we got during our 2 weeks trip.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great value</span> and location We stayed at the Hotel Caravaggio for two nights and it was everything I was looking for- good location, clean, and a good price. We had a room that faced the building, so it was very quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room itself was very clean</span> and the water pressure and hot water was great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff was very helpful-</span> they answered all our questions and made museum reservations for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The breakfast was more than adequate-</span> breads, cereals, coffee, tea, juice.The location was great- a very easy to walk to pretty much all the major places in Florence.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Good value</span> We stayed at this hotel in early Sept 2006 because of the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. Our room was quite small and faced on to the main road with the park across the street. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The music and voices from the piazza at night were incredibily loud</span>.We asked to be moved to a quiter room and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff thankfully accomodated us</span>. The back garden is lovely for a drink,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff are friendly</span> and the location is close to everything. We did have a good stay but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>beware if you given a room facing the park</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>GOOD HOTEL EXCELLENT LOCATION Florence Italy, Hotel Caravaggio[-]Like the other reviews we were not disappointed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The rooms in the back were quiet</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The location was great</span>. Very close to the market place and many restaurants listed in Rick Steves. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The train was 10 minutes away</span> and the bus was right outside the hotel. There is a small Restaurant next door that has great pizza!The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast at the hotel was one of the best</span> throughout our 17 day trip.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great Hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Very Good Value</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>For Money</span> We stayed in this hotel for three nights at a very good rate (59 euros for a double with breakfast). It was a very pleasant surprise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel is fantastic</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms are very clean</span> and not too small. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast is excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is located just a few streets from the train station and the main touristic sites</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A great place to stay</span> Great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>location close to both the station and the centre of town</span>, great rooms recently refurbished. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Excellent breakfast</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very good staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was at the front and suffered a bit from the nose of the road at noght</span> - ask for a room at the back!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great hotel</span> I stayed at this hotel for my honeymoon. I was so pleased with the room. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and a good size. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff was friendly</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>helpful</span>.
