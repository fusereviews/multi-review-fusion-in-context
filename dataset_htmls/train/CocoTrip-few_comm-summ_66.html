<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed here over Memorial Day weekend 2012. I think this hotel is a steal if you catch it on an off-season weekend when the prices are lower. In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool - very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. This modern, boutique hotel was clean and well-maintained. The beds were heavenly! The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel is</span> that it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in the heart of the French Quarters</span>. This visit was all of our first times in Nola. Being able to walk to key landmarks, check out local art galleries and antiques, and grab a beignet was a huge plus! Other hotel perks: free drinks per guest, free bottled water in the room, 15% off our stay, and chocolates and ginger snaps in the lobby.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is in the very heart of the French Quarter</span>. It is new, clean, and has good facilities. WiFi, breakfast, and a very well equipped business centre was free (normally charged for at other hotels), so I felt like I had good value for money. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were friendly and helpful</span>. As this hotel has only just opened, there were a few very small teething problems in the area of service, but I am sure this will be sorted out in no time. I would definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>3 couples - friends for 30+ years, vacationing together for the first time. The hotel was fabulous - the rooms were clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable. The pool area was lovely and a wonderful way to end the evening. The location - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>perfect walking distance to everything</span>. The staff pleasant and professional. My husband and I had been to the French Quarter 15 years earlier and we begged our friends to share this experience with us. Thank you for making this a most memorable experience for us.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is located</span> less than one block off of Bourbon St <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in the heart of the French Quarter</span>. The service was outstanding and the accommodations were clean and comfortable. It was a pleasure to stop after a full day on the road, enjoy some hot food and relax. The courtyard was very nice and relaxing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everyone from the front desk to the general manager made us feel welcomed and comfortable</span>. Well done!</div><div class='text-box'>Beautifully remodeled <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel in the perfect location</span>. Very clean and very quiet - unbelieveable since it's only 1/2 block off Bourbon Street. The staff was excellent, the bar was a nice quiet retreat and the courtyard is charming. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to NOLA!</div><div class='text-box'>Our room was very nice, and the service was excellent. We felt like this was a real bargain, especially regarding the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location in the center of "the quarter", yet it was easy to find</span>. The room was clean and well arranged. Valet parking is really required.</div><div class='text-box'>Super breakfast included in price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great</span> convenient <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location</span>. Hotel was clean-service outstanding. Maybe need a little help retreiving car</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel are friendly and the hotel is ideally located for a stay. and to visit the French Quarter etc.</span></div></div>
