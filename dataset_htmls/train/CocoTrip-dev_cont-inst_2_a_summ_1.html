<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Would come back again and again We have been staying at Island Shangri-la once every year for the past 7 years. They have continued to improve their service year after year. The service is impeccable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were renovated</span> a couple of years ago <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and they added a modern twist</span>. But the level of comfort and 'homeyness' has been retained. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>With the Pacific Place mall right underneath the hotel, it is so convenient</span> to just go down and shop, knowing that even if you carry a lot of bulky items. There is no worry about riding through the mrt or lining up to get a taxi. You can just catch the elevator and go right up to your room. It is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>always a perfect experience staying at the hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Good, but not unforgettable</span> This hotel is certainly good enough as a business hotel. However, I really will not stay here for a leisure trip. As mentioned in another review, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>there are just no personal touches</span> or charm. The staff is polite but the service is more mechanical, rather than from the heart. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>There is a pool</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it offers a view of skyscrapers nearby</span>. It's really quite hard to relax in this evironment.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is not bad</span> as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>it is connected to the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>subway</span> via a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>big shopping mall</span>. However, in the morning, a cab ride can take quite long to reach the central business district due to traffic jam.</div><div class='text-box'>OK, not spectacular. I spent a few nights at the Shangri La in August. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>found the overall experience lacking</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are bland, all function with surprisingly little style</span> (surprising given the strong feng shui influence in HK). The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>also small</span>, even by HK/Toyko standards. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Lunch at the cafe was expensive and disappointing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was much better</span>, though also very expensive.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The pool is really nice, and the gym is good</span>. The staff was OK, but interactions felt rushed and reminded me more of a NYC business hotel than a true 5 star.Don't be afraid to try somewhere else.</div><div class='text-box'>once again, great stay once again, a great stay, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>upgraded to a harbour view</span> as it was our silver wedding aniversary, flowers, fruit etc as well, i love this hotel so much, such humble and smilley staff considering it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>regullaly voted one of the best hotels in the world for everything</span>, fab possition, great rooms, wonderfull staff, do i own it or work for them? no,we just love staying here, well done, shangri- la once again!</div><div class='text-box'>consistently excellent I stay at the island SRL frequently with business, and it isconsistently excellent - staff are always amazing. Isupposethe only picky downside is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>if you like modern it may be a littlechinzy for you!The</span> service is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>outstanding.the bar lady in the foyer bar has remembered the drink I have on every visit</span> (as she does with every repeat guest!) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the pool is simply relaxation at its</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>best!Highly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>recommended</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>hotel</span>, deserves its reputation Really <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>great location next to luxury shopping mall</span> and park. We stayed in the lowest category room (deluxe peakview) and had no complaints.
