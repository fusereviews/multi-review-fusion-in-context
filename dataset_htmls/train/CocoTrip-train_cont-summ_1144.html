<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We wanted to stay in the Marais, and I found this hotel on the internet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We were extremely happy with our stay</span>, and will return here again. The hotel is spotless. While our room was a bit small, it had a wood beam running through the ceiling which lent it that Parisian ambience. And <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the bathroom was spacious</span> with a wonderful tub for bubble baths. The breakfast was huge with many choices. A metro stop is kitty-corner across the street, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the neighborhood is very nice</span> with grocery stores and cafes within a block of the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Sam at the front desk was so nice</span>, and gave me special flower honey for my sore throat.thanks, Sam. I'll be back!</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I just returned from a week in Paris, staying at the Austin Arts et Metiers hotel. It was a lovely experience all through. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The guys working at the front desk were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>all very friendly</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>helpful</span> (and all spoke English, though we tried to use our very limited French when we could), the room (we had one of the ones facing the back - not as scenic as the ones with windows on the front, but rather charming in a big-city way) was VERY quiet and peaceful, and when they say it's near a Metro station they are not kidding; it's right in front. The location is perfect for sightseeing trips. Highly, highly recommended.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a very friendly hotel</span>. Smallish but that I how I like them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The location is fantastic</span>, 50 metres from the Metro and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>only 2 stops to the river</span>. I gave breakfast a miss at the hotel and enjoyed my first meal of the day at a cafe. I would recommend this as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the rooms were</span> quite okay as far as size was concerned and it also was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>very clean</span>. Lift was also okay (sick of walking up stairs by the time I checked into this hotel) and room was a/c. All in all a good place to stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>But if you want to look out of the window at sights of Paris, this hotel is not for you.</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It was good but the rooms was so small</span>. But really nice and with quiet street so was great sleep at night. It is kinda hard to find because it is hidden a bit with the main streets. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Centre Pompidou was really close</span> - like 5 min walk but true is , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>when you want to see Eiffel Tower and Louvre then is better take metro</span> what is not again very easy to drive.Paris metro is the worst and very difficult i m ever seen. But well, it is Paris and huge city so dosnt matter where do you booking you still need public transport . But yeah <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>overall we was like this hotel and why not get back there</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was cleaned to a very high standard</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The shower was great</span>, lots of hot water <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>with plenty of pressure</span>. It was a freezing cold weekend outside and was nice to come back to a warm room. Didn't try the breakfast as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>we were surrounded by cafes and were a short walk or metro ride to all the local attractions</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Nothing bad to say about this hotel</span>, even the slight rumble of the metro didn't cause concern. I haven't visited Paris for a long time but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the price seemed reasonable for</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location and size of</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the room</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for a night after renting an apartment around the corner and not being able to re-enter it at 11pm due to a problem with the lock! Quelle disaster! Fortunately this hotel was open and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the friendly concierge</span> gave us heavily discounted rooms for the night. The rooms were great - clean, comfortable and secure. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would have gladly stayed on</span> but our problem was sorted out the next day. If anyone wants a review of an apartment on the fifth floor of 22 rue Montgolfier, I'll gladly supply one.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was</span> lovely and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>bathroom was huge for european standards</span>! Breakfast was very filling and they even helped us have a bit to eat at 5am before our airport transfer came. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were very helpful with our billions of questions about paris</span>! Location was fabulous, pretty much across the road from the metro! Free internet was also a bonus! Highly recommended hotel for a paris trip!</div><div class='text-box'>This was the first time I stayed in a hotel in Paris, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I was very satisfied</span> with it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5 8'>The room</span> was not very big, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 8'>had a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>nice bed</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>shower</span>, and (important during a hot summer!) airconditioning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Staff was very friendly</span> and, to my astonishment, even understood my terrible french. After breakfast <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>you can reach the subway in half a minute</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was fine for the price.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It definitely was not a glamorous hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The staff was nice and there at all hours of the day and night.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">They were helpful with directions around the city but not very helpful booking excursions.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The room had an odor but was relatively clean.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The bathroom was small but had what you needed.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hair dryer was a bit weak.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The shower pressure was acceptable.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The bed was comfortable.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is not in the greatest area.</span></div></div>
