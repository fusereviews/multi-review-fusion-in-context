<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This is my second stay at the Pullman Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Billed as a five star hotel. My view is its more like a 4* hotel</span>, well situated in Barcelona, not too far from the 5 star establishment , the Arts Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It's a functional business Hotel with all the room amenities</span>, ( fast wi-fi in room, multi channel TV, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Bath and shower, modern ( art deco)</span> , nice roomy lobby etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>on most nights the restaurant was not open for dinner</span> though the chef was flexible to prepare dinner for a small party per- arranged. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We were not disappointed with the food</span>. Tasty and well presented with generous portions Rooms are mid size and comfortable, but pricey ( it was GSM congress week, I guess).</div><div class='text-box'>A great hotel for a weekend break. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>We thought the breakfast spread was excellent</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our room with a</span> balcony and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>sea view</span> was perfect and the sea breeze was lush. Everything was in good condition - smart bathrooms and good facilities. Only gripe would be crappy pillows and not the softest linen on the beds but i suppose one can always find something to complain about (or at least i can!) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The kids with the families tended to stay downstairs in the lower pool area leaving the younger set (us) to chill by the more modern</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>pool on the roof</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The location was great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>as</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>it's a minute form the beach</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and it's a short walk or cab into town.</span> well recommended</div><div class='text-box'>Very good hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>close to the party-beach-area</span>:<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> 1 minute walking</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We got a room with sea view at 5th floor left wing</span> which is great since the sun stays very long on the balcony. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Distance to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>old town</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>(picasso museum)</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>is about 15 minutes onwards</span>. Staff is superior: very friendly and very helpful! Fitness: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>fitness centre in the hotel</span> is tiny but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>there is a fitness park about 2 minutes walking distance</span> for 16eur/day which provide a good facility. Fun: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>we were using the jacuzzi on the roof top few times</span>. Very cool sitting there, enjoy a glass of wine and overlooking Barcelona. I will be here again!</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at the hotel or 4 nights in August 2010. Everything about this hotel is 5 star and is a def hotel I wold stay in again if i stayed in barcelona. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>Breakfast was lovely</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>and catered for all people(very impressed</span>). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>Hotel has 2 pools</span> which were fantastic My only negatives were 1. No English tv stations 2. Mini bar was very expensive so avoid at all costs FYI - If you don't want to be ripped off with expensive meals then avoid the sea front! We paid 55 euros for 2 pasta dishes and 2 fizzy drinks!</div><div class='text-box'>This is a thru 5 star hotel with excellent service. I can really recommend this hotel. It has very attentive staff. I had a great room (first floor 116), quiet, spacy, clean and very nicely decorated. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>This hotel has 2 great pools</span>; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>1 roof top pool</span> with bar and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>1 pool on the ground level</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>It is situated close to the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Port Olympic, the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Beach</span> and Barcelonetta. So <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a great location</span>. It is a great hotel for a combined city / beach vacation.</div><div class='text-box'>A beautiful hotel next to the beach with impeccable customer service. The rooms are nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the pool is great</span>, but the hotel's greatest asset is the staff, who really go out of their way to treat all of their guests like they are special. Even though we are definitely not one of their high-revenue customers, everyone in the hotel treated us like we were royalty. I highly recommend the Pullman Skipper.</div><div class='text-box'>Though one short block off the actual sand, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the place has great beaches in both directions</span>. If you don't want the beach, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>there's a very fine rooftop pool</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>views of the sea</span>. There's also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>a nice cafe right beside it with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>good</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'> affordable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>breakfast</span>. It's not cheap, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>very nice</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotel was very trendy, loved the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>bathroom</span> which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>was utterly luxurious</span>:) large tv and comfortable bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6 7'>Breakfast was good</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>too</span>. Staff were extremely helpful with advice and hints on getting around the city.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is worth the higher price.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It has a rooftop pool as well as a ground-level pool and is perfect for either a beach vacation or city break.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Great location only a minute or so from beaches in both directions and close to Port Olympic as well as a fitness park two minutes away from the hotel.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Beautiful, luxurious bathrooms that are in an excellent condition.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">All amenities are available in the rooms, and those on the higher floors have the luxury of stunning sea views.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Wow!</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The food was really nice with affordable breakfast available at a nearby cafe if you prefer.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The restaurant wasn't always open but breakfast was lovely.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has two pools a fitness centre and also a jacuzzi on the rooftop.</span></div></div>
