<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed for 2 nights at the Marmara on February. The hotel is at Taxim sq and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Bosphorus view rooms have a great great view</span>. Rooms are nicely decorated, clean and the service is excellent. It does not have the luxury of a 5 star hotel.more of a 4 star i would say.but with a 6 star view. There is free high speed internet in the business centre, and free wifi also.The position is ok but in istanbul due to the terrible traffic u never know how much time it will take to arrive anywhere. We had a dinner at the roof garden restaurant which has very nice views over the city and Bosphorus. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Food was good</span> as was the service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Generally this hotel is a good choice to explore istanbul</span> and have a really pleasant stay.</div><div class='text-box'>I travel to Istanbul on business about 3 times a year. I have stayed at a variety of places. This time, I got a good rate at the Marmara Taksim, so I gave it a try. I was very pleased with the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is excellent - right on Taksim Square</span> so you can get to various parts of town and it is across the street from the subway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>The room was</span> a bit dated, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>with wonderful views</span>. The true selling point was the staff: by far the friendliest and most helpful I have ever seen in Istanbul. And in a place where customer service is friendly, that is saying a lot. Everyone at this hotel was wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>I will stay there again.</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel has really great location</span>; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the metro is only 2 minutes from the hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the Istiklal Street only 2 minutes from the hotel</span>. There are a lot of cafes around the hotel. The service in the Hotel is very friendly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>rooms are</span> clean, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>comfortable and cosy</span>. If you need non-smoking room a you just need to tell this to the reception upon your check in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast is very nice but this is not 5-star hotel breakfast</span>. The is Free Wi Fi internet in the rooms. The luggage delivery is very poor as we had to wait 30 minutes to get our suitcases but we needed our luggage very urgently and we were calling to the front desk 3 times.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is in a great location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>bang in the center of it all with istiklal right across the street so there is plenty of things to do</span>. The food within the hotel is terrible but there is a starbucks and an excellent restaurant called the kitchenette located right under the hotel so it makes up for it. The rooms are quite small but have the latest amenities so not much to complain there, although you can hear the street noise even from the 15th floor! Overall im not sure i would stay there again, would def stay at the hilton in taksim or swisotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I have been several time in this hotel both for business and turism. The hotel is not new but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>the quality is still high</span>. The location is just in the center of Istanbul and to go to historical part you can use the metro or do a long but nice walk in the city. The shopping area is very close. The room are nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>many of them are with a great view</span> of the the sea. The breakfast is very rich, the service is good and the staff very efficient.</div><div class='text-box'>We really enjoyed our stay in Marmara Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>The rooms are nice designed and big</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>The view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>from the rooms</span> and especially from the roof (with the pool) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>is fabulous</span>. We had always a place by the pool to relax after a day in the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 7'>The location is perfect</span>, the shopping area is a few minutes away and there are also a lot of different restaurants and bars around the hotel. The receptionist were very friendly and helpful.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>The hotel was great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the people are very nice</span>, they were very nice with the children, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the breakfast is good</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the view out of the room was very pretty</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>the location was great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the buses go there the taxis go there</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the metro is there too</span>, every thing was great.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The best place to stay in Istanbul</span> is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>close to Taksim as its always vibrant and busy</span>. The Marmara is right on the beginning of taksim and has <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a metro station</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>bus stops across the street</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The service was very good at the hotel</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>we were generally happy with our stay here</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Wonderful hotel.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location is perfect - you are at the starting point of the ever exuberent Istiklal Street and the buzzing Taksim Square.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The metro station is right in front of the hotel and all the transport options are easily available.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a delight to stay in - very comfortable rooms of more than the avearge size in Istanbul hotels.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The only issue I have is that the mattress was a bit too soft.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was good enough by the European standards.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The view from the rooms is great, on all 4 sides.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Strongly recommended that should you wish to stay in the new Istanbul area, this is the hotel to be in.</span></div></div>
