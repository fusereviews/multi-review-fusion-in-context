<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I have stayed in this hotel for 10 days for the second time and will definetely be back again! Apart from hotels <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>excellent location ( it's near all sightseeing places )</span> the rooms were cozy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff friendly and ready to help me</span> with connecting my laptop to the wireless internet, to give me advice where to go and which trasport to catch. Beside fluent English and Turkish they speak all ex-Yu languages ( Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Bosnian ) so it is very convinient for people from these countries to stay there. Room service was quick ( beverages only ) , towels changed daily and room and bathroom kept perfectly clean -spotless! Definetely coming back here when I come back to Istanbul for some leather jackets shopping :) and this time bringing friends as well ! Miljana Jovanovic</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent money/value hotel, breakfast included. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Location is great just opposite of Grand Bazar in quite street</span>, good for tourist who want to stay close to everything. If you are one of us, looking for a cheap stay, and you look for very clean and secure hotel/hostel this is a great choice. Rooms are comfortable, especially those on 6th floor. The only minus is that you have only one way transfer, if you choose airport pickup as we did, you have to pay for transfer to the airport, but fortunately this is not a big problem while they have pretty cheap taxi's there in Istanbul :-). All in all, really worth every cent. Great job guys. Greetings from Croatia.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for several nights in mid March. The rooms were clean and comfortable, free internet access in the lobby and a tasty breakfast in the morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location in the old city</span>. Right near the Grand Bazaar, and walking distance to Haggia Sophia and the Blue Mosque.The only issue we had was the cigarette smoke from the lobby constantly drifted into our room. We had to put a damp towel under the door. For 35 Euro's per night - it was well worth it.</div><div class='text-box'>my wife and I stayed 3 weeks there. do we need to add more.? of course you might find better somewhere but more expensive, but you will for sure find lot worst at same price <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is very well located</span> , close to grand Bazaar and blue mosque but also seashore where we could go for a run <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff was very friendly</span> and gave us on 6 floor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a room with view on the Bosphorus</span> at a attractive price so I will be back there when back to Isatnbul</div><div class='text-box'>Booked in Inter Hotel last August 2009 but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>had to cancel</span> after a month due to work load. I just sent them an email <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and they returned my Deposit</span> of 25 Euros to my credit card. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Other hotels will not do that</span>! Will definitely book again in this hotel because I read a lot of satisfied guests. I also want to experience what they experienced from staying in INTER HOTEL. Thank you guys!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is</span> not only <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a convenient location</span>, but very clean and very comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff are friendly</span> and the breakfast delicious. Very reasonable rates and altogether a good place to stay which is situated 5 mins from the Grand Bazaar and the tram. I have been before and will stay there again without a doubt.</div><div class='text-box'>very good service, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff is very friendly and helping</span>, pick and dropp of when you stay few days, free internet ( for me very important), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>near to meny historical places</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The breakfast was excelent, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>very friendly and helpful staff</span>, clean rooms, and well worth the price. I would stay here again and again.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located in a great area and the room with a view was overlooking to Bosphorus.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">On top of this the staff were all friendly and super helpful.</span></div></div>
