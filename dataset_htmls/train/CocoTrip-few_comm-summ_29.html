<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>After reading earlier reviews I was concerned that the facilities and expereince would not be as nice as I had hoped. From the description of the room we rented I thought it would be tight quarters. I was pleasantly surprised to find the atmosphere and facilities to be excellent. We stayed in a small suite, bedroom and a pull out couch. We had plenty of <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were very comfortable</span>. The pull out couch was of excellent quality and slept better than some beds I have expereinced during travels. We stayed during the John Hagee ministeries event. The Chateau staff did an excellent job handling the large crowd staying at the hotel and those that came in for the sessions. The Chateau made a nice Spring Break destination for these Michigan travelers.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed last weekend and was disappointed over some details. Room 413 was very noisy.too close to heating/AC units. Also room was right above delivery area which contributed to the noise. Overall not a very welcoming feeling at the Chateau. Coffee pot would not work and when I called to request another the woman at the front desk was rude and didn't seem to believe me. The doormen were unpleasant and wouldn't even smile, especially the one in the afternoon. I come to Branson often to visit family and for vacations and I'm sorry to say this will not be my choice of hotel in the future.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I stayed here before he deployed with the Army. It was so peaceful. The area is beautiful. The staff went out of their way to make our stay something to remember. Some of the small details of this resort really make a difference. The ice cream shop packed up banana spits for us to take to our room. The cafe restaurant had the best food. We can't wait to go back. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Waking up to the chirping birds and the trickle of the water in the indoor atrium made for a nice touch.</span></div><div class='text-box'>First time to Branson, stayed at Chateau on the Lake. It's about 10 minutes past the main strip of Branson activities but it's worth the drive for the gorgeous views and lovely relaxing hotel. For the price and service level of the hotel, I did <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>expect to have a mini fridge (empty or stocked) but our room type (king lakeview) did not have one.</span> We took advantage of the great weather and hotel bar and had a glass of wine out on the deck. So lovely!</div><div class='text-box'>This was everything that i could of asked for. Nice people, nice scenery. it was to die for. I most definitely will be back here again! the food was expensive. but i expected that. pull is 24hours. they also had a movie theater. mainly showed kids movies but they still had one.</div><div class='text-box'>When we pick up our daughter from a nearby camp we always stay at the Chateau and get a special room service dinner. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beds are so comfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we enjoy the room</span> service very much.</div><div class='text-box'>We went for our one year anniversary and had a fabulous time! The resort was stunning and the spa was lovely as well!</div><div class='text-box'>Everything about the resort was perfect! What a beautiful lake!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel are very comfortable.</span></div></div>
