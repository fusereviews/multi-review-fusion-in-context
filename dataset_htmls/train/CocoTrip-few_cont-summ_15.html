<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Okay after all the rave reviews of other guests <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I was expecting amazing</span>. Guaranteed we had the crapiest weather over the NYE period, but we had paid for a package deal and half of what we paid for we never saw, they took some money off the final bill but even still what was outlined in our package was not included. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were aloof</span>; one gentleman behind the counter was very approachable however the rest were rather aloof. The room was probably the smallest we had stayed in ad had a slanting roof which proved extremely difficult to move around as you were continually hunched over. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were not overly interested in what you did and in informing you of anything to do or see, which was quite disappointing</span> after the fantastic experiences we had had in Rome and Florence. Maybe this is the service you receive when you go to Flashy hotels and if this is the case then I am happily never going to a fancy hotel again - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>midrange hotels for me (better value for money</span>)</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I returned to this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>superbly placed</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>hotel</span> for a wonderful four day break. (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>100 metres from St Marco</span>). Right from the start, whilst making my reservation by phone, Jacopo <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>made me feel welcome</span>, and this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>wonderful service</span> contiued throughout our stay. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>resturant for breakfast</span> is right on the lagoon and to sit outside in the sunshine and start your day with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a plentiful multi choice breakfast is a pure joy</span>. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>lovely Hotel helped make our trip</span> to this very special city <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>all the more enjoyable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Our room</span> was not large but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>perfectly equipped</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>A Lagoon view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>would have made it even better</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>maybe next time</span>) I am sure there will be a next time, and definately at Savoia and Jolanda.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights in January 2004 as part of our honeymoon and we loved it. We did request <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>balcony room</span> as recommended on trip advisor.
