<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the XV Beacon recently and from the minute we got out of our car (valet right at the entrance) to the minute we left the service/staff was exceptional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms were beautiful and very clean</span> and much larger than we expected from a historical building. There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston</span> next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life. We would definitely go back to this hotel, combined with the location we had a great experience!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this hotel while traveling on business and it was by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The second I walked in the room, I knew that I wasn't going to want to leave and ordered myself some room service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It has a very classic style with every modern convenience you could hope for</span>. The bed is very comfortable and the fireplace makes it very cozy. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. The shower was also fantastic. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it if you can swing it!</div><div class='text-box'>My boyfriend has stayed here several times for business trips but this was our first leisure visit-service remains impeccable. Still received his personalized business cards and professional attentive service. Rooftop is a nice touch on a warn day to share a bottle of wine. Hotel car service was a great perk as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town. I am a huge product snob-the Lemon Sugar line from Fresh that they provide in the rooms has made me a regular user. And <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the location is perfect-within walking distance to everywhere</span>. When it's colder out, we will return and use the fireplace in our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beautiful room</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Labor Day weekend, the same number of nights as we stayed in October 2007. An elegant, small hotel! The front desk and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room service staffs</span>, the concierges, restaurant and in-room breakfasts, and the chauffeured car service <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were</span> all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>excellent</span>. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room</span> (#407) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was very elegant</span> and quiet, was on the west side of the building, and had windows on 2 walls. Our only problem was that the sink taps were very tight.</div><div class='text-box'>We were on a business/leisure trip. It was a high star rating and deserved it. Around the corner from Boston Common, Fanueiul Hall, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Easy to get to city centre</span>. The hotel breakfast was fantastic, if expensive. Every dish was amazing. When in Boston city, the Mapparium is worth a visit, along with the top of the Prudential building, to get a great idea of where everything is. There are some great museums to visit.</div><div class='text-box'>as local residents and first time guests, we found this hotel exceeded our expectations. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff were nothing but attentive</span> and hospitable. our room was upgraded upon arrival; we couldn't have asked for more. this is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>lovely hotel</span> with not only luxurious amenities but superb staff. we can't wait to return!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed a few weeks ago at this hotel and I heard everything! The walls are thin as paper as i heard every conversation from the room next door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I apprectiate that some builings in boston are older</span>, but if you own a hotel you must do something ot soudnproof it!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Favourite hotel in Boston</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Modern luxury without seeming formulaic</span>. Good for indulgent weekends in town.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Whilst located in a great place for Boston, the hotel rooms are lovey and clean and the room-service provided is second to none.</span></div></div>
