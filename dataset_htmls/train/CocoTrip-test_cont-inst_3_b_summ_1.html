<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I struggled to get accommodation for our wedding anniversary as it clashed with the Spanish Grand Prix. I found the Pere IV on one of my many trawls, so was a bit suspicious that they still had availability. What a lucky girl I am! The receptionist gave us the '<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>most romantic room' - a lovely 9th floor room with a terrace</span> and a complimentary bottle of beautiful cava to help us celebrate our anniversary. The staff could not not have been more helpful and kind, willing to give advice on sights, restaurants, bars etc. Having a pool, jacuzzi and sauna was great after a days sightseeing, although the pool was a wee bit cool! The only downside was that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it was a 10 min walk to get to the main tourist areas, although taxis are plentiful</span> and fairly cheap and there is a metro station round the corner. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>An extremely good value for money hotel</span> which we would definitely use again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>An excellent hotel that delivers every time</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location is away from the city centre but by using the metro (Bogatell located around the block) you can be any where in the city in a very little time</span>. Use the T10 card and the metro is a cheap way to travel. The reception staff are exceptional,Crisanta, Yvonne,David and the other reception staff cannot do enough to make your stay an enjoyable one. The cleaning staff also deserve recognition the rooms and public areas are immaculately clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast</span> in a lovely bright room <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>caters for the most fussy of eaters the choices available are so varied</span> you cannot fail to leave the room satisfied and content ready to start your sightseeing day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>My room(double for single use) was of a medium size</span> but had everything required for an enjoyable stay. I look forward to seeing Magnuss and his team again next year.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved this hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the spa is excellent</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>(despite the additional cost</span>) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the hotel is only a short walk from the metro</span>, and the city centre (Ramblas etc) is only one or two stops away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The area is not as pristine and smart as the rest of the city, but</span> it is very safe to walk late at night, it appears to be an area that is not fully residential, however taxis are plentiful and bars / <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>restaurants are within easy walking</span>. La <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Sagrada Familia was the view from our window</span>, how brilliant to wak up to that! The staff and reception were incredibly friendly, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the hotel is very smart and clean</span>. We will definately stay here again when we visit in 2011.</div><div class='text-box'>Went to this hotel with a group of 18 of us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The hotel is lovely</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the rooms were big</span> and very clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The hotel staff were helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and seemed really organised</span>, they put our rooms next to each other on the same floor which was great and even let us check in early <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>The breakfast was lovely lots to choose from</span>, when we were going home there was a safe locked room to put your cases. We all said we would definately stay at this hotel when we come again. Just a warning got a taxi from the hotel to the airport which was 24 going and for some reason 43 going back.</div><div class='text-box'>Me and my boyfreind stayed here for 3 nights and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it was one of the comfiest sleeps ever</span>. The bed was two double beds pushed together so it was really big! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There was a complimentary mini bar</span>, not alcoholic though and there were only a few drinks and they don't top them up either but meh! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast was awesome buffet with lots of pastries, bread and cheeses:</span>D The only things is that it's quite a walk into town. To wall to port olympic it's about 15 mins down a looong road. Then from Port Olympic it's another 15-20 mins to port vell.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>This hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 7'>iseverything you expect frrom a 4 star hotel</span>. Very clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>comfortable rooms</span> and good service with a smile from all the staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>The area is mainly industrial</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>but my wife and I</span> walked everywhere and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>never felt any threat</span> whatsoever. It is about 10 mins walk to the port, 10 mins to Sagrada Familia and 15 mins to Ramblas.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for one night in the summer. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Well air conditioned comfortable room with free mini bar</span>. The room needed a few touch ups, but on the whole was decent for a quick sleep and off out again. Breakfast was very basic continental. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>A pleasant experience</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'> did the job</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The staff are very nice but the place is very grubby and old fashioned. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The towels are like cardboard</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>The area is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>not nice,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>a bit industrial</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Would not stay there again. More like a 3 star</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel will provide a pleasant experience at a four-star rate as expected.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is good value for money and it delivers on every stay.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This is an optimal location because you can easily access restaurants by foot as well as public transport for quicker access further afield.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Inside the room there are great views and it is of a medium size.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">There is a free minibar included as well as air conditioning to make the room even more comfortable.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The morning buffets were really tasty and featured plenty of pastries, breads and cheeses.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">You will find there are plenty of choices for even fussiest of eaters.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">If you don't mind cardboard towels and industrialized areas, this is the hotel for you.</span></div></div>
