<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>The check in went very smooth. The staff was friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It wasn't the nicest hotel I've stayed at, but it wasn't the worst either.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The room was a good size</span>. The bed was very comfy. We couldn't hear any of the other guests while we were in our room. They had a free breakfast in the morning, which was continuously restocked. They also have waffle batter and waffle irons. That was nice to have something more than cereal and muffins. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>We found the location to be perfect</span>. It backs right up to the ocean and there are many shops and restaurants in either direction on the boardwalk. I didn't go to the OC to stay in my hotel room, so I was pleased. I would definitely stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Best customer service I have ever received at a hotel! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The maids were so pleasant and sweet and were not forceful about trying to clean your room</span>. The guys down at the front desk were so helpful and would start a genuine conversation with you while you waited for a taxi (etc). We were in room #307. Even though <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it said it was a city view rather than the ocean view rooms,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>you could</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>still</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>see the ocean</span>! It's smack in the middle of the boardwalk; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>a great location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>It's a HUGE room</span> with tons of space. There's a couch, stove and a great king sized bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Nothing to complain about</span>, always clean and the staff was always there to help. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 8'>Great value for the location</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>We stayed for 4 nights in May for just $300</span> !. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>We had a room with an ocean view</span> (not ocean front) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>which means</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>you can see the ocean from your balcony</span>. We were in the building with the pool. It was great that they had a pool because some of the days were just too chilly to swim in the ocean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The location is great.close to the inlet</span>, but not too close. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I'm getting ready to book again</span> for next summer. Also, check out JR's for dinner.just up the main road! Very nice, but kid friendly! Check out there website for the deal we got. [-] I hope this review has been helpful.</div><div class='text-box'>My family of 5 stayed at the Comfort Inn Boardwalk - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>you couldn't ask for a better location</span>! Located at the southern end of the boardwalk -close (but not too close!) to where all the shops and amusements are. Great outdoor pool - right on the boardwalk. Just a few steps from the beach. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The room was very nice</span> - 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. Nice kitchenette area (with dishes and silverware). The only complaint is the continental breakfast - small bagels, mini muffins, small danish wrapped in plastic, 2 choices of cereal and some fruit. But the rest of the place was great! I would definetely stay there again!</div><div class='text-box'>I read lots of reviews on trip advisor before settling on the Comfort Inn. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>It was the perfect location</span> for my 9 yr old son. We were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>within walking distance of</span> all the games and rides on <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>the boardwalk</span>. We had an easy walk onto the beach. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>The room was clean and of adequate size</span> for two. The bathroom was small but updated. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We had a 1st floor oceanfront room</span>, which sounds great except for the noisy boardwalk at 2am. The free breakfast had several options including cereal, eggs and sausage, and pastries. Staff was not overly friendly but certainly handled all of our requests quickly.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Great location</span>! Maids were very courteous as was the rest of the staff. Breakfast wasn't bad for continental- you could make waffles and there was plenty of coffee. Priceline deal was pretty good. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 7 8'>Room was what I expected</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 8'>for the price</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>and</span> for a room with a "street" view <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>we had a pretty good view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>of the ocean</span>! Will stay here again as the location was one of the best on the boardwalk. Indoor pool was great and outdoor wasn't bad either!</div><div class='text-box'>From the staff to the rooms I have nothing but good to say about my stay here! We walked in the door and were cheerfully greeted from the three people behind the desk. Within in 10 minutes we were in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>our very clean room</span> and standing on the balcony looking at the gorgeous view! The staff was so helpful in giving directions and opinons on where to have dinner and things to do. I will definetly stay here again. Thanks Comfort in for a great weekend!</div><div class='text-box'>We enjoyed our trip to OC this year. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>hotel is</span> just the right size and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>very clean</span>. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>wish it wasn't so expensive</span>. It's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>nice, but doesn't compare to the other hotels</span> that are asking <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the same price</span>. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and respectful. The pool is in the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>perfect location</span>, but in need of new steps into the pool. I'd like to see actual steps installed instead of the wobbly ladder they have now.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">It was ok for our needs</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">but I thought it was overpriced for what you get.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Of course Ocean City is overpriced.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room said oceanview and the building we were in was behind the oceanfront building and the view was from the side over the balcony.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The cleaning was not very good.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The same dirt was under the sink in the bathroom the entire time.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">They only cleaned the high surfaces.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The room itself was fine and the balcony pretty nice.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The location is great, but it was a disappointment for the hefty price.</span></div></div>
