<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>spacious</span>, and furnished with nice pieces that truly demonstrate their concern with quality. The only problem is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the beach is not really a beach, but a 30 feet stretch of sand where they park a couple of dirty kayaks and 2 or three jet skis</span> . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The water looks dirty and it filled with seaweed</span>. The rest of the waterfront is not for swming as there is 5 feet concrete wall drop . I even saw what I think its a grey water discharge pipe . Bottom line is that if you want <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a nice comfortable hotel</span> and don't care about the private beach, this is for you . If you are looking to get wet in the blue waters of key west while in hotel grounds, look for other options. Also parking is $18 . They will not tell you . You will see it in your credit card later.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Awesome rooms, made me feel right at home</span>, Make sure you get a poolside or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beach facing room</span> the others just dont make the cut, we were first checked into what I would call a closet for <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>$190 a night, which is still quite expensive</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we upgraded to a poolside for $50 more and it was well worth it</span>, Just absolutely adored the room, had a kitchen, the best bathroom and a balcony view of the pool, Only flipside like other travellers say there is no real beach and you cant swim its just a stretch of sand to sun yourself so dont be fooled by the beach! Key West has <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a lot of water activities</span> so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>we didnt really miss the beach</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We stayed at this Marriott</span> for our wedding. We stayed three nights. It was amazing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The hotel room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was beautiful. Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, marble floor,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>jetted tubs</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>walk in shower</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> etc</span>. I really enjoyed our stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel is not in the heart of Key West, but they offer a free shuttle service to downtown every 30 minutes and return shuttle every 20 minutes after the hour</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was nice, our room was clean and the decor was great</span>. I would highly recommend staying there!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Had a great weekend stay at the marriott</span> in Key west. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are fantastic</span>. Two bedroom suite was wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The staff was very accomodating</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>they offer free transportation form the hotel every hour to downtown</span> key west. the bus drops you right off at margaritaville, The hotel pool and bar was very spacious, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>they have a small sand beach</span> also. The hotel restaurant was jammed saturday night, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it is 5 minutes from the airport</span>. I higly recommedn this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Key West and stayed here using Marriott points. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Room was stunning. Waterfront view</span>, 2 balconies, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>huge living room</span>/<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>dining room/kitchen</span>. 1 1/2 baths-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>jacuzzi tub and spacious stand up shower</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Shuttle service to Duval was nice but would have been nicer to have been within walking distance</span>. Shuttle back to hotel at night was full of rowdy drinkers. Received breakfast passes since I'm a Rewards member-it only included fruit/bread area-not even the usual Marriott powdered eggs-that section was $4 extra per person.</div><div class='text-box'>We were all set to go and just the night before came under the weather with flu and had to cancel the booking. Normally the hotel charges $150 as a penalty but upon learning about our situation the hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>management happily agreed to waive the penalty</span>. This was the week after Thanksgiving, so it was not as if they were heavily booked and would find last minute reservations. Very few times have I seen <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>such a courteous hotel management</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a wonderful property <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>located right as you enter the island</span>. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful and the pool and poolbar are a blast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Rooms are very nice and comfortable</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the staff is great</span>. Definitely a great option for your trip to Key West!</div><div class='text-box'>We've stayed here two times in the past 3 years. I've got to say that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the accomodations are still excellent</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>service from the staff is outstanding</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This Marriott is nice and comfortable.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">There are lots of water activities but no private beach.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Perfectly located to the airport as it is just a quick car ride away.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Although it is not in the heart of the city, there is regular transportation via the free shuttle service.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Remarkable rooms that provide stunning waterfront views.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Each room is extremely spacious and there is the option of a Jacuzzi bath tub as well as a shower.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are quite pricey, and it is worth upgrading to experience the luxury of a beach facing or poolside room with a balcony.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The staff was very nice and the management was extremely courteous.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Highly priced parking at this hotel, and the water provided is particularly dirty.</span></div></div>
