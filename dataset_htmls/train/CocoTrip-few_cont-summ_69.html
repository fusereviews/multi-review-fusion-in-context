<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great old hotel in a great location I stayed at the Ambassador a week ago and had a wonderful time! I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>did have one of the infamous windowless rooms</span> (the hotel is an old renovated warehouse of sorts) but the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>ambiance of the authentic New Orleans</span> decor (exposed brick, high ceilings, wood floors) made it almost seem like being in old France. The hotel is located close to everything there is in New Orleans and a close stumble to Bourbon St. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>found</span> the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>valet staff to be prompt</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>friendly even though they were busy</span> and the front <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>desk staff</span> was quick to attend to any request <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>with a smile</span>. I am definetly staying at this hotel next time I am in New Orleans, and I am curious to see how wonderful the renovations will turn out!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great spot, great rate,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>great effort</span>! Just returned from stay for French Quarter Fest. As we arrived, a bus was dropping off a full load of European students to stay at the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Despite the sudden rush</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we were checked in cheerfully</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>quickly</span>. Everyone went out of their way. Location is great for getting to (or away from) Quarter craziness or Garden District, and Warehouse area has its own charm and eateries. Room was comfortable and quiet, if a bit dark. Bandito's off the lobby great for delicious breakfast with no wait (!) or tequila any time. We'd recommend the Ambassador to anyone traveling to NoLa for biz or pleasure.</div><div class='text-box'>Got Bugs? The room service advertised is a joke.unless you like greasy Mexican food. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>cleaning in the rooms was horrible</span>; barely vacuumed or dusted in almost 2 weeks of staying there and the bathroom was just barely cleaned everyday. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>management is lacking and not too interested</span> in customer service. My roommate was chewed up by some bugs in her bed and was left with huge welts that itched and oozed. Since it was booked through Expedia.com, there was nothing that they would do except take off the mandatory $4.95 phone surcharge (although that was pretty cool, since all local and continental long distance charges were included in that).It was a big disappointment from start to finish.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Welcoming and friendly staff</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel</span>, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains</span>. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location. It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions (the steamboat tours, downtown New Orleans, The French Quarter, etc).When I return, I would definitely go back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>AMBASSADOR HOTEL, NEW ORLEANS Please be advised when booking at this hotel to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>request a room with a window. Ours did not have one</span> and the door into the room was the only way out. Had there been a fire my husband and I would have been dead. I am wondering how these rooms ever passed code. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The inexpensive rates and free parking were not bargain enough</span> for the potential danger.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Buyer Beware</span> Stayed during a convention. It is as kindly as I can put it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>a dump</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>horrid,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>poorly kept and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>bad condition</span>. The mattresses, boxsprings and pillows looked as if they were purchased from a Katerina Auction. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>The service was comical</span> and even though it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>states they serve breakfast they only serve coffee and pastries</span>. Could not wait to check out.</div><div class='text-box'>Once is Too Much If you enjoy fraternity house decor, you'll love the Ambassador. No extra charge for the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beat-up furniture</span>, lightless broom closet rooms and paper thin walls. Hotels like the Ambassador don't count on repeat business. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>There are much</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6'>better hotel options</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>in New Orleans</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a Great Stay</span> Just wanted to say that I had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great time</span> at the Ambassador in New Orleans The rooms were great, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>housekeeping was great</span>, very polite and Dave Smith the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>room manager was excellent</span> with everything I needed. Hope to go back soon. Thanks</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The overall vibe of this place is pretty great and authentic to the city.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It's a neat spot and puts in a huge effort.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Some of the rooms in the hotel do not have windows and furnishings are in a bad condition.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The cleaning of the rooms could be improved.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The management of the hotel seemed disinterested , but the valet staff and desk staff were efficient and friendly, despite being busy.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel only serves coffee and pastries as the breakfast offering .</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was cheap and had free parking included, but they were not reason enough to choose it.</span></div></div>
