<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My name is Vince Palumbo and I am a coach/player for the Australian Stickfighting Team, and I would like to tell you all about this beautiful Regal International Airport Hotel which is in Hong Kong. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Me and my team</span> of 16 athletes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>did a one night stop-over in Hong Kong</span> on our way to the Philippines where we were travelling to so that we could all compete at the 2009 World Stickfighting Championships which were being held in Cebu City there in Philippines. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Our stay</span> at the Regal International Airport Hotel in Hong Kong <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was just fantastic</span>, and we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>all enjoyed the hotel and service very much</span>, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>if ever you need to do a stop-over there in Hong Kong for the night</span>, please do not hesitate to contact the manager at the hotel by the name of Mt Jon Chiu, and I am sure that he will bend over backwards to really try and accommodate you or your group. So go ahead and spoil yourself for the night, and I am sure that you will be pleased with the service that you recieve there, ok! Enjoy this Fantastic Hotel in Hong Kong! Regards from GM Vince Palumbo (Australia)</div><div class='text-box'>My family and I concluded our two-week Easter trip to Berlin and London and returned to Hong Kong. After a long flight, we landed in Hong Kong's international airport around midnight despite very bad weather - raining cats and dogs. As we were very tired and the weather was terrible, we decided to spend the night at the Regal Airport Hotel before returning home in the city centre the next morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Thanks to the convenient location</span> of Regal, the heavy downpour did not get us wet as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>hotel is connected to the airport</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>by an enclosed link bridge</span>. As a regular hotel guest, we got an upgrade this time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Our suite</span> has a family room and a bed room, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>large and comfortable</span> enough for my family of three. We had the best sleep in days amd woke up the next morning refreshed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The buffet breakfast at the cafe on the lower ground floor was very good too</span>, not to mention the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>good and friendly services</span> provided by its staff. No wonder, Regal was awarded the best airport hotel title for last couple of years.</div><div class='text-box'>We've stayed twice at this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Rooms were good</span> but the more important factor for us was the hotel's location. For both times, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the hotel's location allowed us to make the most out of our short visit to HK</span>. We did not waste any travel time between hotel and airport, either at arrival or for departure, since it was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>interconnected</span>. We are not hassled or stressed with rushing <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to the airport</span> to catch our flight. The hotel also had regular free shuttle service to Tung Chung (outlet mall) and several stops at downtown HK. This also saved us bus/train fares. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>also</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>has a pool and gym</span> which unfortunately we were not able to try since we were always out exploring HK.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here for a night in transit to Kathmandu. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Average hotel</span> to stay only if you are in transit, otherwise, why one should spend more money <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>here at the airport</span> rather than staying in city areas. Everything was expensive but some of staff were nice and room facilities were okay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>So many things in my room was initially not working</span> and I had to call house keeping to fix it such as safety deposit box, TV remote, Refrigerator (with anything inside).and so on. There was nothing that really attracted me so much. But in general <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I saw they have different facilities within hotel complex, including</span> many restaurants and bar, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>pools etc.</span></div><div class='text-box'>We stayed one night between our flights from Australia to North America and arrived late in the evening. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>room temperature never rose above 18 degrees Celcius</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and the shower taps were broken</span> and therefore shower temperature adjustment was extremely difficult. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Service was just OK</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>breakfast which was included in our package was pretty good</span>. For the price of the room we did not feel we received good value at all. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Room was clean</span> but bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood and there were no face cloths.</div><div class='text-box'>My third time in this hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>excellent staff</span> from Front desk. Luggage was sent quickly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>quick check in</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>There is no other hotel closer to the airport</span>. Good location for early flight visitor like me.</div><div class='text-box'>I usually avoid airport hotels like the plague, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Regal at HK is very good</span>. Clean <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>spacious room</span>, good dining facilities and a reasonable room rate.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A quiet place despite the airport</span>. Free transport was wonderful.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A lovely place to stay, with direct links to the airport.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Excellent luxury amenities on site, including a swimming pool and gym for the guests to use when they please.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located near the airport but convenient for short visits to HK.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are inconsistent.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Some are great in that they are large and comfortable while others are disappointing because of non-working equipment in the rooms.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The cafe on the lower ground floor of the hotel provides a very good buffet style breakfast for guests.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Check-in was quick.</span></div></div>
