<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stepped off the train and walked past all the taxi drivers and touts and 3 minutes later we were in the reception of the Apollo Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The receptionist</span> was fluent in English and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>explained all the functions of the hotel in a clear and concise manner</span>. We found breakfast to be a typical Continental style with bread , ham , eggs and jam . The coffee machine was excellent and we had plenty of time to sit and watch those around us eat and admire the views. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was handy for the trams and the subway</span> and we also walked to the Coloseum from the hotel and it was a pleasant 20 minute walk. For a 3 star hotel it was a pleasant experience and we will repeat again when next in Rome</div><div class='text-box'>Third time staying at this quaint family owned and operated hotel - and just as enjoyable a stay as previous visits! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Located in centro storico Roma within view of the mighty Roman coloseum. There are plenty of little restaurants, coffee shops, and tiny grocery stores in the vicinity</span>. A tasty buffet breakfast is served each morning in the rooftop terrace dining room - including custom made delicious cappucini! :) Many, many thanks to the delightful family and staff of Hotel Apollo. We appreciate all your kind care & thoughtfulness. We look forward to our next trip to Rome and again staying at your hotel!</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for five nights back in October last year. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel is in a great location allowing you to walk to all the main attractions and explore, rather than having to rely on public transport</span>. Breakfast of pastries, fruit and cereals etc being served on the roof terrace is a great way to start the day and there are plenty of restaurants near by. Really good friendly staff, very clean and tidy. Can't rate the Apollo enough, will definitely stay again.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of May 2010. The hotel is at a very central location, within 10 minutes walk to Colosseum. But the room is very small. The shower place is tiny. I am a tiny person. But I could hardly turn myself when I am in the shower place. The bed is small and there are holes in the bed sheet. The breakfast is reasonable, but not exciting.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We selected this hotel because of the location</span>. It was great. We did not stayed at the hotel itself but in an apartment some corners away. It was big, clean and had all that we were looking for. Lots of restaurants, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a metro stop in front</span> (Cavour) and the colisseum just some minutes away. When going back to Rome for sure we will stay again in this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Apollo in the end of July. What can I say?! Excellent hotel, friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful stuff</span>, really good breakfast especially cakes and cappucino in a big cup. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>7 minutes walk to Colloseum</span> and 15 to Trevi Fountain. Nicely decorated spacious room with big bathroom. When I'm in Rome next time I would definetely stay in this Hotel!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Good location</span> and bedrooms where a very nice size. Breakfast on the roof was a good variety and tasty food. The only bad thing I can say is that the geaser broke and we were without cold water on our 3rd day, but that could happen to anybody. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Always somebody available at reception to help</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location.walking distance from Coloseum</span>. The small pizza place next door.is a must place to take out.Night staff did not speak English.but day staff did. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>They arranged a cab for us.who was there ahead of time</span>.Breakfast was heavenly.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideally located and good for local public transportation.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful too.</span></div></div>
