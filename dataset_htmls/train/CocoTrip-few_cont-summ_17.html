<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Okay after all the rave reviews of other guests I was expecting amazing. Guaranteed we had the crapiest weather over the NYE period, but we had paid for a package deal and half of what we paid for we never saw, they took some money off the final bill but even still what was outlined in our package was not included. The staff were aloof; one gentleman behind the counter was very approachable however the rest were rather aloof. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room was</span> probably <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the smallest</span> we had stayed in ad had a slanting roof which proved extremely difficult to move around as you were continually hunched over. The staff were not overly interested in what you did and in informing you of anything to do or see, which was quite disappointing after the fantastic experiences we had had in Rome and Florence. Maybe this is the service you receive when you go to Flashy hotels and if this is the case then I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>am happily never going to a fancy hotel again -</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>midrange hotels</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for me </span>(<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>better value for money</span>)</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I returned to this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>superbly placed hotel for a wonderful four day break</span>. (100 metres from St Marco). Right from the start, whilst making my reservation by phone, Jacopo made me feel welcome, and this wonderful service contiued throughout our stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The resturant for breakfast is right on the lagoon and to sit outside in the sunshine</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>start your day with a plentiful multi choice breakfast</span> is a pure joy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This lovely Hotel</span> helped make our trip to this very special city all the more enjoyable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Our room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>not large</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>perfectly equipped</span>. A Lagoon view would have made it even better (maybe next time) I am sure there will be a next time, and definately at Savoia and Jolanda.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We stayed here</span> for three nights in January 2004 <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>as part of our honeymoon and we loved it</span>. We did request a balcony room as recommended on trip advisor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was</span> beautiful <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a perfect view of the grand canal</span>. It s location was perfect <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>three doors away from the bridge of Sighs and 200 m from St. Marks Square</span>. The room was plush , exposed beams, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>tastefully decorated</span> but a bit disappointed that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>there was no bath in the bathroom</span>. and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room (or suite as it was called) was small by suite standards.1</span> room.(Bed with a couch and table) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend it if you wanted to splash out for a special occassion</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>it is a bit pricey</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>In the middle of everthing</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> St. Marks, Museums, anf fine restarants</span>. I really believe I could spend the rest of my life in this most beautiful city. The hotel and staff are magnificent. We have stayed there on two separate trips now and look forward to the third soon. My wife just loves to get lost waling the canals and alleways. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Wonderful breakfast at the hotel</span> as well. Steps away fro the San Zaccaria vaparetto stop.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel</span> is very conveniently located from the San Marco stop and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>faces the Grand Canal</span>. The staff were not necessarily friendly, but they were not rude either. They were helpful in giving us information and directions as well as storing our luggage after checkout so we could explore a bit before our scheduled time of departure. We were pleasantly surprised when we returned after dinner to find turn down service and chocolates on our pillows :-)</div><div class='text-box'>what a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>beautiful place looking out onto the St giorgio magiore church island</span>.
