<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We had a pleasant stay at hotel playa karma. It's located on a busy street so if you're a light sleeper, the traffic might bother you at night. We did hear the dog a couple of times but was it was only for a few minutes. Overall, I was impressed with their customer service. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was very</span> nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>accomodating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Mario was very friendly</span>. We arranged a couple of tours with karma trails and we were happy with the tours we chose. Antonello arranged a breakfast-to-go box before we headed out to one of our tours in the morning and it was abundant, filled with fruits, bread, water and cake. If you prefer a hotel with great customer service, choose hotel playa karma.</div><div class='text-box'>We had a wonderful time at Playa del Karma! We finished our Yucatan-trip with 2 nights, and really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. We had two several rooms (one at the garden and one above the lobby/reception), both really nice with lots of space and big beds! The Italian <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>people who run this place are really helpful with everything you need and provide great service</span> with the breakfast buffet (we loved the mexican eggs in the morning) and free beachtowels. Playa del Karma is a lovely place with a beautiful garden with a small but wonderful pool, lovely to relax after a day at the beach.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel is a great value, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>service is very friendly</span>, the inner courtyard with small pool and lights strung across palm trees is a lovely oasis, and the rooms are clean and equipped with AC, tv and small deposit box. There was a high vaulted thatched roof which made the room feel airy but unfortunately not too sound proof. Right across from the new ADO bus station so a good place to stay if you are catching an early morning bus from the station. Just a couple blocks from 5th ave where all the action happens at Playa.</div><div class='text-box'>For those of us baby boomers who remember being sensitive flower children Hotel Play del Karma really suited us. The mature greenery of the courtyard had the serenity and grace of years of wise existence; of course we could relate! The patter of raindrops on the thatched roof of the room reminded us that we were in a beautiful tropical climate. It was a charming effect that would have been absent had we stayed in a concrete & glass megalith. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here. The breakfasts above the garden were special.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at Playa del Karma on a recommendation from a friend. We were extremely satisfied with the accomadations and the staff. This hotel was the best hotel I've ever stayed at in terms of value for what you receive. The rooms are cute (a little rustic but clean and comfortable), the courtyard is beautiful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff went above and beyond to serve us or answer questions</span>. The location is great, just three blocks from the beach. We would definitely come back.</div><div class='text-box'>This little hotel is lovely with nice rooms with a lot of character. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful</span>. Free breakfast at their sister hotel about a five minute away is nothing special but very good. Only problem was that the hot water didn't last very long, but everything else was perfect.</div><div class='text-box'>Very good 3 star hotel a few blocks from beach.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everyone very helpful</span>.Rooms large with patios and hammocks,nice little courtyard with small pool.</div><div class='text-box'>Small but very comfortable rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Extremely helpfull staff</span>. No private parking. Near all of 5th Ave fun.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at this hotel is very friendly and helpful.</span></div></div>
