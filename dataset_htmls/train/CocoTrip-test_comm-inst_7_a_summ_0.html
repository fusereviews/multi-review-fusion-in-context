<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms are clean and spacious</span>, and furnished with nice pieces that truly demonstrate their concern with quality. The only problem is that the beach is not really a beach, but a 30 feet stretch of sand where they park a couple of dirty kayaks and 2 or three jet skis . The water looks dirty and it filled with seaweed. The rest of the waterfront is not for swming as there is 5 feet concrete wall drop . I even saw what I think its a grey water discharge pipe . Bottom line is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>if you want a nice comfortable hotel and don't care about the private beach, this is for you</span> . If you are looking to get wet in the blue waters of key west while in hotel grounds, look for other options. Also parking is $18 . They will not tell you . You will see it in your credit card later.</div><div class='text-box'>Awesome rooms, made me feel right at home, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Make sure you get a poolside or beach facing room the others just dont make the cut</span>, we were first checked into what I would call a closet for $190 a night, which is still quite expensive, and we upgraded to a poolside for $50 more and it was well worth it, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Just absolutely adored the room</span>, had a kitchen, the best bathroom and a balcony view of the pool, Only flipside like other travellers say there is no real beach and you cant swim its just a stretch of sand to sun yourself so dont be fooled by the beach! Key West has a lot of water activities so we didnt really miss the beach!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this Marriott for our wedding. We stayed three nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was amazing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel room was beautiful</span>. Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, marble floor, jetted tubs, walk in shower, etc. I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is not in the heart of Key West, but they offer a free shuttle service to downtown every 30 minutes and return shuttle every 20 minutes after the hour. The staff was nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>our room was clean</span> and the decor was great<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>. I would highly recommend staying there</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Had a great weekend stay at the marriott in Key west. The rooms are fantastic. Two bedroom suite was wonderful. The staff was very accomodating, and they offer <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>free transportation</span> form the hotel every hour <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to downtown key west</span>. the bus drops you right off at margaritaville, The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel pool and bar was very spacious</span>, and they have a small sand beach also. The hotel restaurant was jammed saturday night, and it is 5 minutes from the airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I higly recommedn this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Key West and stayed here using Marriott points. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Room was stunning</span>. Waterfront view, 2 balconies, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>huge living room/dining room/kitchen</span>. 1 1/2 baths-jacuzzi tub and spacious stand up shower. Shuttle service to Duval was nice but would have been nicer to have been within walking distance. Shuttle back to hotel at night was full of rowdy drinkers. Received breakfast passes since I'm a Rewards member-it only included fruit/bread area-not even the usual Marriott powdered eggs-that section was $4 extra per person.</div><div class='text-box'>We were all set to go and just the night before came under the weather with flu and had to cancel the booking. Normally the hotel charges $150 as a penalty but upon learning about our situation the hotel management happily agreed to waive the penalty. This was the week after Thanksgiving, so it was not as if they were heavily booked and would find last minute reservations. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very few times have I seen such a courteous hotel management.</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a wonderful property</span> located right as you enter the island. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the pool and poolbar are a blast</span>. Rooms are very nice and comfortable, and the staff is great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Definitely a great option for your trip to Key West</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>We've stayed here two times in the past 3 years. I've got to say that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the accomodations are still excellent and service from the staff is outstanding</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is really enjoyable and definitely recommended.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel are clean and spacious.</span></div></div>
