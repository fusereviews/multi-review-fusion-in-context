<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We were originally due to stay for 10 nights and we booked for three people - my teenager daughter and her friend and myself. On arrival in the room the beds were very small double beds and only two of them - I spoke to the manager who said that all the rooms were exactly the same (untrue) and that for an extra $10 we could have a rollaway bed. The rooms are far too small for more than two people. The site is not well maintained and the pool not clean. We were then stranded due to the volcano and having enquired about staying for an additional five nights was told that we could have a special price of $39 per night - only to find out on the website for the hotel that the cost for that period of time would be $32 per night. Scammed! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - there are far better places to stay which are closer to the amenities</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and both times have been totally trouble free. We stayed for 10 nights and had no problems. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was</span> clean and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cleaned every day</span>, towels and bed sheets changed we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>came back</span> every day <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to a spotless room</span>. We only seen reception <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff</span> to check in and out but they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>seemed friendly</span> enough and there were no additional charges over what we paid when we booked. The location is exellent, took about 10 mins to get to disney and about 20 mins to Universal and Seaworld. Aircon and tv worked well and there was always a parking space outside our room despite the hotel being quite busy over spring break. I will definatly stay here again if back in Orlando :)</div><div class='text-box'>The "Hotel" is actually like something straight out of My Name is Earl. Filthy carpets, bugs in the refridgerator and all over the room. Horrendously misrepresented by the pictures on the website, the bbq area and lagoon are disgraceful. I paid for 2 star Quality, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>would never</span> stay here, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>recommend it,</span> etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>In fairness the staff are very friendly and all issues raised were dealt with, they seem to know</span> with the quality of their resort, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>they HAVE to provide good service</span>. Bar is very reasonable, with Long Island Iced tea recommended. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>My honest advice, not even worth the small amount paid</span>, I will never stay here again, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>you have been warned</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Is a nice hotel with many amenities, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room service was excellent</span>. The shuttle was not so confy, because run for 3 hotels, but Champions is the first so you can have a seat haha. If you have a car, fine, because if you don't have a car you don't have many alternatives to eat. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I like this hotel and really recomend it</span>. This hotel is near to a Chinese buffett, Dominos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Walgreens, McDonalds.</div><div class='text-box'>This is one of my favorite hotels in Kissimmee. It is a Instead super comfortable, accessible parks and disney all the best places you can eat in your vacation. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The attention is very satisfactory</span>. I have two Sometimes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>visiting this hotel and will not be the last. since its price and the comfort of your rooms make your stay a very welcoming</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I had a lovey stay. The resort is a value, and taking the back road on Sherberth, I traveled to Disney in 6 minutes. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff is warm and attentive</span>. I felt like I was at home with family.</div><div class='text-box'>Champions World Resort was exactly what we were looking for. A brief relaxing weekend near Orlando Fl. The rooms were nice and clean, and the hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was very responsive and attentive</span> to our needs. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I</span> highly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>recommend this resort</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stay here every year. I like the hotel, its clean, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the employees are very nice</span> and the prices are great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I will continue to stay here</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The service provided by the friendly staff here was really excellent.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Overall a very recommended hotel.</span></div></div>
