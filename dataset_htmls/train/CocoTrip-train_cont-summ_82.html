<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>A friend who lives in London booked us in this hotel because it was the cheapest in this area. We had two triple rooms with private shower and toilet, we paid 79 pounds per room per night and this price also included breakfast. The first thing we checked when we went in the room was the beds if they were comfortable - they were new and comfortable, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms were clean</span> and the toilets spotless. we are very happy with the hotel and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we will go back again</span> and we'll <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>recommend it to other people</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were at St. Mary's Hospital for treatment and were looking for a hotel, they recommended us the continental as they said many people who accompany patients stay there and were very happy, so we booked there. It is just around the corner from the hospital, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff were friendly</span> and very helpful - we were pleased that we discovered this hotel and we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>will recommend it</span> to friends and others and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we'll</span> definetely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>book again</span> hopefully this time for leisure.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed with my girlfriend for a few nights at this hotel at the beginning of August.

It is nice hotel, clean, quiet, in a leafy square and most important safe. The prices are really low, almost half the prices of other hotels in the area as we asked few hotels on our way to the continental to compare. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>We</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>liked this hotel very much and we will be back</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>recommend it to others</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We visited London in July.
