<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My husband and I booked the Monte Carlo for a weekend away without our two small children. We had never been to Ocean City,MD and I was nervous after reading some reviews of the Monte Carlo. We arrived early and even though the room was not ready they called our cell phone to let us know when it was. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was very friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was a nice size</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we had a nice balcony with a side view of the ocean</span>. The location was perfect. My husband fished on the pier while I did some shopping. We also went to two of the bars and were able to walk. We never had to move our car. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We will definitley be returning next year</span> with our children and staying at the Monte Carlo!</div><div class='text-box'>We just came back from a family vacation and stayed at the Hotel Monte Carlo. We've been to Ocean City a few times and this is our first time staying there. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating</span> since the moment we arrived. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel was very clean and the room was a very nice size</span> for the price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The boardwalk</span> and beach <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>were less than a minute away</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The pool was very nice</span> although there should be a bathroom up there. We didn't try the continental breakfast but we heard it wasn't much. But you couldn't beat the price considering where the hotel was located. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We will definitely be going back next summer</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Our experience at the Monte Carlo Hotel was wonderful. Our stay was 8/28 - 8/30. It's a great hotel and very affordable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was very helpful and pleasant</span>. They helped with recommendation on restaurants and day activities. We were warned about parking before we got there, but parking was no problem at all. The front desk gave us a parking pass where we left our car the whole weekend with easy access to it if necessary. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The location of the hotel was</span> perfect! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Just a block away from the boardwalk</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel is in a great location for walking to the boardwalk</span> and amusement park area. The indoor pool is basically useless. The outdoor pool is nice but only 3 foot deep. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room was spacious and fairly clean and smelled nice</span>. The A/C system was great and kept the room nice and cool. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff are</span> very nice. Everybody at the front desk was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very helpful, friendly and cheerful</span>. Very nice people there. Parking was tight and cramped. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I would recommend this hotel</span> for budget minded travel. The pros better the cons.</div><div class='text-box'>Not sure where some of the bad reviews are coming from. We stayed for three nights and had no problems whatsoever. The front desk <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>staff was</span> courteous and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>helpful</span> and even the maintenance man was super <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Clean room</span>, clean bed, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean bathroom</span> and we loved that the jacuzzi was in the room instead of the bathroom. Parking was a little tricky but not a problem and the location was fantastic. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>would</span> definitely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>stay here again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Our stay at the hotel monte carlo was wonderful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The personnel was very friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The rooms were clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and very roomy</span>. We especially liked the balcony to sit on at night and listen to the music in the next hotel across from us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I would recommend this hotel to our friends and we will be renting again</span> this summer as well as in the past years . Thank you guys you are the greatest. Karen Kuhn</div><div class='text-box'>This was my family's first visit to Ocean City. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>I liked the location</span> of the Monte Carlo. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It was super close to the boardwalk</span> and ocean. The location was nice because with having two young children we were close to everything (within walking distance). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>The room was clean and the staff was wonderful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Room was CLEAN</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff was very friendly</span> and accommodating. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel is great location to the</span> beach and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>boardwalk</span>. Very nice Indoor and outdoor pool available, which was great for my little ones. Wish there was a bit more parking at the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Would stay here again</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Our room was a nice size and clean.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">We had a wonderful view!</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The maid cleaned the room every time we put the maid sign out.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The location of the hotel was very close to the boardwalk - there were no streets to cross to get to the boardwalk and the view from the rooftop pool was amazing!</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">We would definitely stay at this hotel again.</span></div></div>
