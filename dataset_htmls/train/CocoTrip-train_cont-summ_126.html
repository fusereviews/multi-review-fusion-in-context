<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We had another room booked in San Diego in Shelter Island. We were not impressed so I immediately called The Dana. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>They were so accommodating and got us right it</span>. We had such a great experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>The staff was friendly</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the view from our room was amazing</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the property setting</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was beautiful</span>. Our kids (6 & 12) loved the pool that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>was overlooking the harbor</span>. Had breakfast at the casual restaurant (very good) and dinner and the Firefly (wonderful service and great food). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>Can't wait to plan my next trip to San Diego AND book The Dana</span>! Very convenient to Sea World, Belmont Park, and not a bad trip to the fabulous San Diego Zoo.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We stayed at the Dana</span> on Mission Bay for Spring Break <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and it was awesome</span>. We had a poolside room with 2 queen beds and it was very reasonably priced. We were so close to everything and were able to go do many things and still have time at the pool everyday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We rented a pedal boat right on the hotel grounds to explore the bay</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>It was a great family-friendly hotel and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>the staff was great</span>. Our children are 5 and 7 and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>can't wait to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>go back to San Diego so we can</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>stay at the Dana again</span>. Honestly, if it were up to them they probably would have never left the hotel during our 5 day stay.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and teen daughter and I recently spent 3 nights at the Dana in San Diego. Our room was in the watertower building. The hotel room was just as nice as the internet picure if not nicer. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The room was extremely clean and</span> very modern and functional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>We loved the balcony overlooking Mission Bay</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The beds were very comfortable</span> with nice bedding. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>front desk</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>service was very efficient and friendly</span>. The maid service was also very effecient. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The shuttle service</span> to Sea World and to and from Amtrak <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was very prompt</span>. The drivers were both very friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>We will definately be back to stay</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>at this wonderful hotel when in San Diego</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We stayed in one of the Bay view rooms</span> on the 3rd floor with a balcony with chairs. We had an awesome view of the bay and could see the fireworks at Seaworld every night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Our room was very clean and comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The concierge at the hotel was very helpful</span> with information on what to do and making reservations at the Top of the Market for our 33rd Anniversary. Breakfast at the Blue Pearl was included in our Bed and Breakfast room. We were very pleased with both the food and service. We stayed for a week and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>would definitely return and stay there again</span></div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Dana on our recent trip to San Diego with our daughter and her husband and 10 year old twin girls. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>All of us loved our experience at the Dana</span> - we stayed in the rooms that view Mission Bay. The kids loved the swimming pool and the table tennis. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good and the location was ideal. There is a higher end restaurant at the hotel and although we didn't dine there it looked like a nice place to eat. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>We would definitely recommend this hotel and we plan on going back again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>stay at the Dana was excellent</span>. From the moment we checked in to the time we checked out the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>staff was</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>courteous and professional</span>. Our room was very modern and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>view of the bay was</span> absolutely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>beautiful</span>. We were lucky enough to have gorgeous weather and spent all day lounging on our balcony. We had appetizers and wine at the firefly(?), all was exceptional. In the morning our room service was quick and fresh. I will definitely recommend the Dana to my friends and family.</div><div class='text-box'>We took our Grandson to San Diego and stayed at the Dana. Checking in, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff was very helpful</span> and polite. The grounds at the Dana are beautiful and very clean, the pool area was very nice. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>room was</span> right <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>on the bay</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>view was beautiful</span>. We spent a day at Sea World and the Dana <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>offered free shuttle back and forth</span>.
