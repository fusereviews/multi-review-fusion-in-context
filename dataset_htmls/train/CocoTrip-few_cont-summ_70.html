<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great old hotel in a great location I stayed at the Ambassador a week ago and had a wonderful time! I did have one of the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>infamous windowless rooms</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel is an old renovated warehouse</span> of sorts) but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the ambiance of the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>authentic New Orleans decor</span> (exposed brick, high ceilings, wood floors) made it almost seem like being in old France. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is located close to everything there is in New Orleans and a close stumble to Bourbon St.</span> I found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the valet staff to be prompt and friendly even though they were busy</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the front desk staff was quick to attend to any request with a smile</span>. I am definetly staying at this hotel next time I am in New Orleans, and I am curious to see how wonderful the renovations will turn out!</div><div class='text-box'>Great spot, great rate, great effort! Just returned from stay for French Quarter Fest. As we arrived, a bus was dropping off a full load of European students to stay at the hotel. Despite the sudden rush, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we were checked in cheerfully and quickly</span>. Everyone went out of their way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Location is great for getting to (or away from) Quarter craziness or Garden District</span>, and Warehouse area has its own charm and eateries. Room was comfortable and quiet, if a bit dark. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Bandito's off the lobby great for delicious breakfast</span> with no wait (!) or tequila any time. We'd recommend the Ambassador to anyone traveling to NoLa for biz or pleasure.</div><div class='text-box'>Got Bugs? The room service advertised is a joke.unless you like greasy Mexican food. The cleaning in the rooms was horrible; barely vacuumed or dusted in almost 2 weeks of staying there and the bathroom was just barely cleaned everyday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The management is lacking and not too interested in customer service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>My roommate was chewed up by some bugs in her bed and was left with huge welts that itched and oozed</span>. Since it was booked through Expedia.com, there was nothing that they would do except take off the mandatory $4.95 phone surcharge (although that was pretty cool, since all local and continental long distance charges were included in that).It was a big disappointment from start to finish.</div><div class='text-box'>Welcoming and friendly staff, elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>The staff was very welcoming and friendly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>and assisted me with every aspect of my travel</span>, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel</span> itself is absolutely gorgeous, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains</span>. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions (the steamboat tours, downtown New Orleans, The French Quarter</span>, etc).When I return, I would definitely go back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>AMBASSADOR HOTEL, NEW ORLEANS</span> Please be advised when booking at this hotel to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>request a room with a window. Ours did not have one</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the door into the room was the only way out. Had there been a fire my husband and I would have been dead</span>. I am wondering how these rooms ever passed code. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The inexpensive rates and free parking were not bargain enough for the potential danger</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Buyer Beware Stayed during a convention. It is as kindly as I can put it a dump. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The rooms were horrid, poorly kept</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and bad condition</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>mattresses, boxsprings and pillows looked as if they were purchased from a Katerina Auction</span>. The service was comical and even though it states they serve breakfast <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>they only serve coffee and pastries</span>. Could not wait to check out.</div><div class='text-box'>Once is Too Much If you enjoy <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fraternity house decor</span>, you'll love the Ambassador. No extra charge for the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>beat-up furniture</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>lightless broom closet rooms and paper thin walls</span>. Hotels like the Ambassador don't count on repeat business. There are much better hotel options in New Orleans.</div><div class='text-box'>Had a Great Stay Just wanted to say that I had a great time at the Ambassador in New Orleans The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>rooms were great</span>, housekeeping was great, very polite and Dave Smith <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the</span> room <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>manager was excellent with everything I needed</span>. Hope to go back soon. Thanks</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is an old historical building but with genuine decor befitting New Orleans.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Very authentic.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is located to everything you need in New Orleans and not far from Bourbon Street.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were of an average quality, with rather basic furniture and facilities.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The cleanliness of the rooms aren't to a very high standard either.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The stay started off well because the valet staff are efficient and despite being really busy they maintained a friendly attitude.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The front desk staff were also attentive and lovely, but the management let the staff down because they were clearly disinterested in tending to customers.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast options were really limited to pastries and some coffee.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Despite inexpensive rates and free parking this hotel is potentially dangerous; there are bed bug infestations that can leave you with huge itching welts.</span></div></div>
