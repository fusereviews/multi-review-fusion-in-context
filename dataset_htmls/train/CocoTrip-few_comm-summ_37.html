<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this was a great place to stay</span> for the two of us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel</span> decor was fun and the staff were quite accomodating. There isalso a small restaraunt in this hotel that had great food However, for us it was located a bit off course in the sense that is is not subway convenient. Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. As the elevator is original to the hotel, it must be staff operated. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this. Our other choice was walking 3 flights of stairs.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the Gladstone this June for 7 nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Its a great hotel</span> and represents great value in a really interesting area of the city. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character.although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. The downstairs cafe serves great food, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays.</span> The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.</div><div class='text-box'>The Gladstone <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel is a great place</span> in Toronto for so many reasons, aside from being a hotel. They have created unique spaces for musicians, artists, foodies and families.to showcase, perform and indulge. They support and promote local and organic eating ( by the way they have a FRY BAR.sweet potato, potato and taro too with tons of toppings). Harvest Wednesdays supporting field to table eating (yum) are not to be missed.and while you are there, you'll know why you need to try the Gladstone.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed.</span> I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day. The Gladstone is clearly more interested in being an arts/cafe/performance/bar venue for hipsters than a hotel. Details don't get addressed, the rooms are crazy small, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it's just not comfortable for any extended stay</span>. I will try The Drake next time.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Fantastic hotel</span>, great drinks, food and the staff super nice and cool. only complaints were that our left over margarita glasses weren't cleaned up, mattress wasn't great as it sagged in the middle and the shower felt like we were washing in a horizontal MRI machine! Opted not to say anything as we were only there for a couple of nights though would probably stay at the Drake Hotel next time we take a trip.</div><div class='text-box'>After a long flight we found reception to be slightly frosty and unfriendly. You need the opposite after a long trip. The room was also slightly disappointing. We found it to be small and the design a bit half hearted with a very strange shower! It's beautiful old building but could do with a bit of warmth and character. Having stayed elsewhere in Toronto <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I'd recomend the hotel a couple of blocks east</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>No 'Big City Attitude' here! The Gladstone had really friendly and engaging staff. Rooms were unique and fun.no cookie cutter boxes with the same old crap. Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun. Great food, music and decor and location are killer. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Lots to do around the hotel. Try it out if you want something different</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Gladstone is a great escape</span> in the city. It is well located to hang out on Queen St West as well as the theatre district and more mainstream shopping, and has much more charm than most hotels. Overall the rooms are interesting and fun, but the beds are the best part.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a great place to stay and it is a recommended hotel.</span></div></div>
