<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Overpriced Stayed there with my family Aug 1 to 4 2005. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Good points - its on Bourbon Street.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>Bad points - its on Bourbon Street</span> + everything else. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Asked for a quiet room months ahead, we were given a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>room next to the elevator:</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 4'>noisy</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> lots of convention goers yelling up and down the corridor at 3 a.m.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Parking is difficult - they have a garage (about $30/ day !)</span> but its small and spaces are tight. My wife had to go to ER whilst we were there, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>they didn't even know where the nearest hospital was</span> ! Constant feeling that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>they wanted our cash but didn't want to provide anything like service</span> in return. Avoid.</div><div class='text-box'>Had a great time! We splurged and booked two Bourbon Street balcony rooms for a post-graduation celebration with our two young adult daughters. Although the hotel itself is a little long-in-the-tooth, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>its location on lower Bourbon Street can't be beat</span>. There are nicer, fancier hotels and inns nearby, but we chose the Royal Sonesta specifically for its location. Yes, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 4'>it's noisy</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>and you can hear music and rowdy crowds until late at night</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> but we anticipated this</span> too. Bourbon Street was busier for an early June Monday and Tuesday night than I would have expected, but we had fun sitting on the balcony, throwing beads at the crowds who happened to walk by.</div><div class='text-box'>Jazzfest Stay here for 8 nights and for the most part it was very enjoyable except for a few monir things that added up. For about 3-4 days <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the hot water was only luke warm</span>, one day I went out and took off the privacy sign and by 3pm the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>room was not made up</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> had to call housekeeping</span> and when I returned at 4pm, it still was not done, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>had to put in an angry second call</span> to have the room done ASAP. Also one monring I had the privacy sign on and housekeeping still knocked on my door, lucky I was not sleeping.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location cannot be beat</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>service/staff is still very good</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great hotel! I have family in New Orleans so I am pretty familiar with the city.I have stayed in a good deal of places/areas of town. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Royal Sonesta, by far, offers the best location</span> and experience. One of the three hotel bars to the GREAT restaurant for breakfast to the fabulous rooms, this place is a treasure. We had a courtyard room that opened up to the pool deck. BEAUTIFUL! And the price was right too!</div><div class='text-box'>No one returns emails or calls.Upcoming Stay I have booked a room for an upcoming Conference-American College of Cardiology; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I have sent emails to various managers at hotel inquiring what amenities are included for the room price of $300+/ SHOCKER - No one responds</span>. I haven't even arrived there for my MARCH Conference, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I am feeling like this is a poorly managed hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great place on Bourbon Street Stayed one night at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon Street. What a great place, very classy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>you can't beat the location</span>. Went in June so the rates were very inexpensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 4'>Rooms were very</span> clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 4'>quiet</span>. Definitely would stay there again. First Class.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great location</span>, tiny rooms Nice <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>hotel in a great location</span>, but very overpriced. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was small</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>not very well maintained</span>. Parking was also overpriced and the scratched my spouse's custom car when the valet parked it.</div><div class='text-box'>Very nice hotel Very nice hotel. The reception area is extremely nice. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>rooms are also very nice</span> with large flat screens although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>they are quite small</span>.Very good breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Very good location</span> though as a result <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>quite noisy</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel and the surrounding area are noisy but that is to be expected.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location is unbeatable here.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There is some noise but this is a small price to pay for having the best location.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The small room wasn't too well maintained and upon arrival it wasn't even made-up.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Despite requesting a quiet room the room that was provided was really noisy.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff seemed unprofessional and unhelpful.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast provided by the hotel was very good.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The parking situation is quite difficult because the pricing is really high per day.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Additionally there was no hot water and instead was just tepid.</span></div></div>
