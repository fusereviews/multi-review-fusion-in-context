<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>In any season, this is one beautiful place</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is vintage class from a time when quality mattered</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The staff is professional, helpful and always available to answer questions</span> or make you comfortable. I have stayed here more times than I can count and it has been consistently wonderful for many years. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>So close to the never ending beauty of Boston Common</span> and some of the best shopping within walking distances, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>restaurants abound and there is</span> a local flavor that mixes easily with a world class feel. Boston is rich in American history.be sure to immerse and educate yourself. From Paul Revere to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>famous seafood</span> this place has it all. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I have traveled the world</span>, the comfort of this hotel appeals to my sense of tranquility. Tho <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the rooms are small</span>, they render a feeling like going home to visit Grandmom.it<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>'s my favorite place</span> in the world.</div><div class='text-box'>We were very pleased for the most part with our stay during the holiday which included an extra night due to the winter storm. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>front desk staff were professional and very helpful</span>, as were the staff in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 8'>the breakfast restaurant</span> , tea and lounge bar. The rooms were nice, updated some. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There is wireless in the lobby area though there is a charge for it in the room</span> and some services in the business center. We were able to fax at the front desk without a charge. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The Whiskey Bar was not a positive experience</span> and will not be revisited. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was perfect for our needs and we enjoyed staying in the historic hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The Christmas Tea was a treat</span> and enjoyed by all. All in all we would most likely return.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The park plaza was</span> very nice,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>one block from the subway</span>, and only 15-20min to the hotel via subway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We asked the front desk for a renovated room and we recieved a king on the 8th floor</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the room was small but adequate</span> and very clean. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beds were very comfortable</span>, and there were many channels to choose from an the tv. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Room service food was not good, however the front desk promptly apologized and credited our account</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Mccormicks and schmiidt was good (the cowder, and fish n' chips)</span>. What made our stay even better is that we got it for $100 dollars a night through Priceline's name your own price deal!</div><div class='text-box'>When I found an online price for the well-known Boston Park Plaza Hotel for $149/night, I thought there must be a mistake. Or they were doing construction next door. But I never found any problems and got a wonderful rate for a fine hotel at a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>great location near</span> the Boston Garden near <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the Arlington St. subway stop</span>. In fact, we were upgraded for free to the Towers floor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>got a huge room</span>, access to a lounge with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>free breakfast and evening appetizers and to wireless internet</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This was a great place to stay for a mixed business/pleasure trip to Boston</span>. I'd have been happy even if I had to pay more for the room.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>All three of the south bank of elevators malfunctioned the entire four days we were there</span>! One group of guests was stuck in elevator #3 for over an hour and a half. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>My wife and I got stuck between floors twice in elevators</span> #1 and 2 two days in a row when the electronics suddenly just went dead. After fiddling with the buttons it started up again each time after about five minutes. I believe these sorts of maintenance/safety issues are unforgivable in a hotel this expensive and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we will not be staying there again</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>This hotel was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very near the Public Gardens,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>convenient to the Arlington stop on the T and in a central location</span>. The rooms were very nice and spacious. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The staff was friendly and helpful</span>. My only complaint is that the walls were paper thin and we had very noisy neighbors who didn't sleep much on Saturday night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>We called security but that was not much help</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The hotel did compensate us for this inconvenience</span> with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>lunch in the hotel restaurant</span>. Otherwise it was a pleasant experience and a good value</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room is fine but they need to finish the remodel</span> with new baths. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Providing robes would be nice also</span> (like other fine hotels). The location is good for walking tours of the Back Bay and, across the park, Beacon Hill. We also did the Freedom Trail on foot. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>An</span> easy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>excellent restaurant is across the street</span> (Via Matta) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>but avoid ordinary Legal Seafoods</span> unless you like boring food. We got a $220 rate (total w/tax) from 1800hotels.</div><div class='text-box'>Although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the location is great</span>, we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>found the room very small, and not soundproof</span>. There are no coffee makers. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Would not stay there again</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is perfect for a mixed business/pleasure stay in Boston at any time of the year or season.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is reminiscent of vintage class when quality was key and mattered most.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Travel the world and come back, this may be the favorite place.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">With a central location, the hotel is really convenient for the Arlington subway stop, and the Boston Common.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">If you politely request you can get a really great room on the eighth floor which is a King room.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">It's really big and has free breakfasts and appetisers as well as WiFi internet.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Reasonable service at this hotel, with many members of staff very attentive to their guests.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The security team were not so helpful but overall the staff seemed quite professional.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Food-wise, the hotel does have, The Whiskey Bar, a hotel restaurant and seafood.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">They also had a special treat of Christmas Tea.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">The elevators were not working properly and kept getting stuck between floors.</span></div></div>
