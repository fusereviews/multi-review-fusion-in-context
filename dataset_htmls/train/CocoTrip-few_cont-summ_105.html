<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I traveled here for business for the first time and was somewhat disappointed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There is only wireless internet service in most of the rooms, which I can not use with my office laptop for security reasons.</span> I had to switch rooms in order to have high speed internet access. and the internet service seemed to work only some of the time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The connection wasn't working consistently and nobody in the hotel could help.</span> They offered a toll free number for the tech people at the DSL company. The front desk failed to provide me with my mini-bar key and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack in it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>There were many many tourists in the hotel, which isn't good for business travelers because they tend to make a lot of noise</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'></span> I don't think I'll travel here again unless I am a tourist.</div><div class='text-box'>I stay at this hotel very frequently, and every single time, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>my experience has been fabulous</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is right in the downtown area and 5 min. walk from South Station</span> which really helps me as I frequently take the train from/to New York. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are really nice</span>, bathrooms and linen really clean and above all else, the staff is some of the most friendly I have ever come across, rifht from the front desk to the concierge and housekeeping. Samir Boukhari, the front desk manager is delightfully courteous and has always gone out of his way to help and make my stay very comfortable every single time. Dianna, Aruna and Lexi at the front desk and Anthony with the concierge are wonderful as ever. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would stay here as long as business/pleasure keeps taking me into Boston</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>stayed here for business</span>. It was in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>close to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the theater district</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>shopping</span>, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>There is only one restaurant and a very small bar in the hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>It would have been nice to have additional options</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>There were restaurants close by</span>, but again, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it would have been nice to have had the convenience of additional dining places.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>The fitness center was so so</span>. I was very disappointed that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>there was a charge for internet</span>. When paying the price we paid per night, that should have been included in the room cost. Great concierges.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Boston for one night during Memorial Day weekend. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The staff was great</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'> we were upgraded to a Terrace Suite when we checked in</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was beautiful</span> and very clean/pleasant, although you can't actually go out onto the Terrace so that was bittersweet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We ordered room service which was excellent!</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6'>The breakfast buffet was wonderful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>as well!</span> Great location to all of Boston. Overall a great trip! Will return to this hotel whenever we are in Boston.</div><div class='text-box'>When we booked this hotel we were worried because we saw more negative reviews than good at that time. I have no complainst.the staff was very helpful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>the in house restaurant was excellent</span>, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>rooms were very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Very close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and Marshall's</span>. . .walking distance to all other sites that we wanted to see. . . The only thing I can say negatively is paying for WIFI but that is a problem with all hotels.</div><div class='text-box'>hi, i have read all the reviews and they are a bit mixed.We have <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>just stayed there n i have to say it 's great</span>.Its a central location - we hired a car and left it back 4 days early as parking is so expensive-unless u have to dont hire a car-otherwise park it in the place out in front of the hotel its the cheapest we checked them all i have the sore feet to prove it!</div><div class='text-box'>Disappointing when <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>hotels such as this still charge for wifi access</span>. We didn't get notified verbally about the complimentary breakfast either although it was no doubt in the fine print somewhere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Rooms were nice and clean</span> although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a little boring and the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>bed not that comfortable</span>. Can't fault the location, it was very easy to get anywhere with the subway station a few hundred metres away.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location and greater service at this Hyatt in Boston. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>No more convient place to stay</span>. Came in by train and never needed to have a car. You are right in the middle of everything! The hotel & service is top notch and this isn't my first stay in Boston!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a great and beautiful place to stay for business or for pleasure.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">All experiences here have always been fabulous and convenient.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is close to the theatre district with restaurants close by.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">It is situated close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and other shopping centres and the subway for easy travel.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Rooms in this hotel are really nice and can't be recommended enough.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel only had one restaurant and a small bar, so the choices were limited.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There is a free breakfast provided, but it is not advertised clearly.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There is a charge to use the WiFi at the hotel and the fitness centre was not great.</span></div></div>
