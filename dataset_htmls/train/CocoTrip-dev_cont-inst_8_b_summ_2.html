<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>The Orto de' Medici Hotel, Florence This medium-priced Hotel offers a very good price to service ratio. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are very clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>being an old but refurbished building, it has high and well appointed rooms</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The hotel offers - as a garni hotel - an excellent breakfast</span> (self-service from two tables). Being not on a thoroughfare, it is quiet at night. Its situation in relation to the main attraction, the Piazza del Duomo, is a seven to ten minute's walk. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, especially just opposite is the restaurant Il Cardellino. At the reception English and French is spoken. The service personnel is very friendly and is supervised by the proprietor himself.The Hopp on / Hopp-off Bus can be taken from the Piazza San Marco, approximately 200 meters from the hotel Orto de' Medici, where also other <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>regular bus lines part for the hinterland</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>A room with a view <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>What a great place</span>! Just returned from 4 nights here and delighted with the choice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Central location</span> - only a few minutes walk from the Accademia, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>but tucked away in a side street so as quiet as it can be in Florence</span> (or any major city for that matter!). Ask for room 45, on the 4th floor (don't panic there is a lift), if you want a room with a balcony and a view over the roof tops to the Duomo and Campanile. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Continental breakfast was light but adequate</span>, but hotel too small to serve dinner - not a problem with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>so many good restaurants to choose from</span>! Go and enjoy!</div><div class='text-box'>Short walk from the Madding crowds of Firenze The website was accurate in its promises. The service to arrange for private pick-up from the train station to the airport was excellent as was the arranging for museum tickets. Contact to confirm reservations was propmpt. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are simple, but clean</span> and we slept well for five restful nights. The common room is very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>comfortable</span>, as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>is the breakfast area</span>. The patio serves dynomite gin tonics for happy hour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The hotel is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a pleasant walk from the main downtown sights</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>in a less touristy and more local scene</span>. Would definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Good 3 star hotel in Florence Good 3-star</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>in central Florence</span>, very close to the Accademia and to the Duomo. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Lots of restaurants nearby</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>Room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>is fairly spacious</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>basic in decor</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>and clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Bedroom windows are double-paned, so that noise is not a problem</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Bathroom could use a little updating</span> but would speculate that it has been updated within last 10 years. Good American style stand-up shower. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room</span>, is well above average and in a lovely room which also has a very nice terrace. Friendly front desk.</div><div class='text-box'>Extremely friendly/helpful staff here! The Orto De Medici was a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>wonderful hotel, perfectly located in Florence</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The continental breakfast was grand and offered world travelers a diverse selection of foods and drinks</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>The hotel is superbly clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and beautifully decorated</span>. The front desk staff was the best I've ever encountered. They were compassionate with our lost luggage situation and gladly booked us reservations for the Uffizi gallery.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Although the walls are a bit thin in the room and it seemed a bit noisy at night</span>.I would stay at this hotel a thousand times over.Thanks for a fabulous stay.</div><div class='text-box'>Wonderful <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We had a wonderful week's stay at this charming hotel</span>.
