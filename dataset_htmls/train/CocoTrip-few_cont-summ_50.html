<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the Locanda Sant'Agostin in January '06, we were very impressed with the quality and friendliness of the service we received. Our room was very quiet, if not a little cold, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast was basic continental style</span>, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience Venice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>you</span> really <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>can walk anywhere from the Hotel</span>, the Rialto Bridge and St Marks are only a few minutes walk away. A brilliant holiday - thank you Locando Sant'Agostin we'll be sending our parents your way next year!</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I, as well as another couple reserved 2 rooms on the internet and were very happy with the accommodations. They were clean, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>comfortable</span>, charming, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>centrallly located</span>, and breakfast was a nice start to the day with yoghurt, cappuccino, coissants, cereal. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The rooms were decorated with old world charm</span> and the bathrooms were newly upgraded. The staff was very friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The location was walking distance to all of Venice</span>. It is easiest to take a water taxi or the walk has many bridges and steps for you to navigate with your luggage. -Great value. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Loved</span> Venice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Locanda Sant'Agostin</span> Loretta and Vincent</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel</span>; it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>all about</span> service and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>making sure the guests are comfortable</span>.

The staff at reception could not have been more helpful, booking us tickets to a concert, recommending places to visit and restaurants to eat. Would definitely come back and stay again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A nice and friendly atmosphere</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everyone were very helpful</span> in helping us with arrangement of a water taxi pickup early Sunday morning. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is located so you can easily (< 5 min) reach the places where the Venezians go out</span>. I am sure that we will consider this place, the next time we go to Venezia.</div><div class='text-box'>The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>hotel was ideally located in the centre of Venice</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>in a nice quiet situation</span>.
