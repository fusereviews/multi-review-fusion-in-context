<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>For this trip to 'the dam' we wanted to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a bit more central</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and</span> we hit jackpot with this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Right next to a canal</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>its around 5 mins walk to Dam square, and the same to Jordaan or the Nine Little Lanes. Leidsplein and other more interesting parts</span> are also just a short walk away. The hotel itself is ok, it has a grand entrance hall with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a reception desk staffed by smiley staff members</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The room was quite small</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> but large enough</span> to cope with for just a few nights, but as the city was so close we hardly spent any time in there anyway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were helpful, offering advice</span> about what to see and do, and happy to look after cases after we checked out and went to get some lunch. Would stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed with friends on a business trip and the key to our room didnt work till after 6 attemps of the manager making new ones. it took 2 hours to get this sorted making us late for the important meeting we had and the deal fell through costing us a fortune. Next morning, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the shower came alive and flew of the wall like a firemans hose, scallding each of us and having finally sorting this dangerous problem</span>, we arrived 10 minutes late for breakfast and staff wouldnt serve us. staff then kept us waiting half an hour to check out with no real apoligy for our inconvieniences.staff very laid back and unintrested. All in all a big dissapointment. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Scallding cobra shower very dangerous.BE WARNED</span></div><div class='text-box'>This hotel is exceptional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>For a 3 star Euro hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the rooms are huge</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the views of the canal (Herengeraacht) outside are atmospheric</span>, the location, despite being <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very quiet</span> is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Dam Square, and only 5 minutes to Anne Franks House</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were very helpful</span> and friendly despite the fact we turned up at gone midnight a little wiped from our day in Amsterdam. For the price this hotel really is head and shoulders above its peers, which in Amsterdam can be very seedy. Always stay here when in the `Dam.</div><div class='text-box'>Don't fall for the scam of 'local tax' when checking out. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Fifty euro deposit is taken</span> when checking in for 'incidental' expenses. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>They</span> then <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>try and hold most of it back when you are leaving saying it is a local tax</span>. We paid fully for our trip through a travel agent in UK before travelling so if the hotel have a problem with that they should take it up with them. Kick up a stink like we did and they will back down though. It makes you wonder how many people have been conned with this trick?</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Rembrandt Residence Hotel in April 2006. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We found the hotel to be in a good location</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>our room was quite large</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Bathrooom was also very big</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We had a view of the canal which was wonderful</span> although we could not figure out how to lock the windows. We were on the 2nd floor so it was not a problem. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff was very pleasant</span> and we enjoyed our stay. We would stay here again. We thought the breakfast was a little less than we expected.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is in a very good location</span>, just off a main street <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in central Amsterdam, on a quiet canal street</span>. It is a 3 star hotel which may account for the stained carpeting, thin towels, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>some snooty reception staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The breakfast</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> although a reasonable price,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>was consistently out of items</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> had stale pastries and funny tasting eggs</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Some of the rooms are tiny</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> so try to request a large room</span>, if the staff will indulge your request.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the Rembrandt and found it to be comfortable and clean and in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fantastic location</span>. It was quietly situated but within easy reach of everything we needed. Our rate included breakfast and a boat trip and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>staff were friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room wasn't huge</span> but for a 3* hotel in a central location it was great. We would definitely stay again.</div><div class='text-box'>First time in Europe - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>good size</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>room</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>bathroom</span>, clean, lots of light, comfy bed what more could you want! Would stay again if went back to Amsterdam.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is nicely located in a quiet canal street with being only walkable distance to many interesting places like Dam Square and Anne Franks House.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">While the room is quite small, the view of the canal was wonderful.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">You should try to request a large rom, although the small room did have a big enough bathroom.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the reception and breakfast area were rude and not very helpful.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Although with a reasonable price, the breakfast has very limited quantity and the food tasted funny.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The shower was scallding dangerously.</span></div></div>
