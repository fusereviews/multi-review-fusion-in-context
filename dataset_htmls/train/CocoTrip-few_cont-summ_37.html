<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>this was a great place to stay for the two of us. Hotel decor was fun and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff were quite accomodating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>There isalso a small restaraunt in this hotel that had great food</span> However, for us it was located a bit off course in the sense that is is not subway convenient. Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. As <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the elevator is original to the hotel</span>, it must be staff operated. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this. Our other choice was walking 3 flights of stairs.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the Gladstone this June for 7 nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Its a great hotel</span> and represents great value <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>in a really interesting area of the city</span>. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character.although very smart. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was small but adequate and well kept</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>The downstairs cafe serves great food</span>, and while we were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>there there was live music</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and comedy</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>every single night</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff were very helpful and friendly</span> and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.</div><div class='text-box'>The Gladstone Hotel is a great place in Toronto for so many reasons, aside from being a hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>They have created</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>unique spaces for musicians</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> artists, foodies and families.to showcase,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>perform</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and indulge</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>They support and promote local and organic eating ( by the way</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>they have a FRY BAR.sweet potato, potato and taro too with tons of toppings</span>)<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'></span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Harvest Wednesdays supporting field to table</span> eating (yum) are not to be missed.and while you are there, you'll know why you need to try the Gladstone.</div><div class='text-box'>I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed. I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Gladstone is clearly more interested in being an arts/cafe/performance/bar venue for hipsters than a hotel</span>. Details don't get addressed, the rooms are crazy small, and it's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>just not comfortable for any extended stay</span>. I will try The Drake next time.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>Fantastic</span> hotel, great drinks, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>food</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the staff super nice and cool</span>. only complaints were that our left over margarita glasses weren't cleaned up, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>mattress wasn't great as it sagged in the middle</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the shower felt like we were washing in a horizontal MRI machine</span>! Opted not to say anything as we were only there for a couple of nights though would probably stay at the Drake Hotel next time we take a trip.</div><div class='text-box'>After a long flight we found <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>reception to be slightly frosty and unfriendly</span>. You need the opposite after a long trip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was also slightly disappointing</span>. We found it to be small and the design a bit half hearted with a very strange shower! It's beautiful old building but could do with a bit of warmth and character. Having stayed elsewhere in Toronto I'd recomend the hotel a couple of blocks east.</div><div class='text-box'>No 'Big City Attitude' here! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The Gladstone had really friendly and engaging staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Rooms were unique</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>fun.no cookie cutter boxes</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with the same old crap</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>Great food</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> music</span> and decor and location are killer. Lots to do around the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Try it out if you want something different</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The Gladstone is a great escape in the city</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is well located to hang out on Queen St West as well as the theatre district and more mainstream shopping</span>, and has much more charm than most hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Overall the rooms are interesting and fun</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the beds are the best part.</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is a unique space for musicians and artists etc to hang out and perform, though some may find that a detriment to their stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideally situated for socialising in Queen St West, as well as the theatre district and shopping areas.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has great music and food available.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are quite unique but a little disappointing, and the shower is like a horizontal MRI machine.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">However the beds are great.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Aside from the unfriendly reception staff most of the hotel staff were very nice.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has great food; from the small restaurant to the fry bar that promotes local organic produce with lots of variety.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">This is a great escape even in the city.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The very old elevator was also crazily fun.</span></div></div>
