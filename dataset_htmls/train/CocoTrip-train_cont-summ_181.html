<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We would go back in a heartbeat! The Mosser exceeded our expectations. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>location was excellent</span>. We are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>able to walk to</span> every place that we wanted to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>shop</span> and to the baseball game with no problem. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff was friendly</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms were clean</span> and comfortable. We had a room that had a community shower and I was a little nervous about how that would work but it was fine. I never had to wait to use it and there was never anyone in the bathroom when I needed it. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff was</span> friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span>. I would absolutely stay at the Mosser again. If you can loking for a nice place in the middle of everything then the Mosser is for you.</div><div class='text-box'>Very cute, clean, great location! We were very pleased with our four night stay at The Mosser. The hotel is very well kept, clean, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the staff was very helpful</span>. It is so nice to stay in a hotel with character rather than one of the bigger, impersonal chains. Our room was nicely decorated and the ceiling fan came in very handy (you do not need AC). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff was always very helpful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>courteous</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We also loved the location</span>, which is in the middle of everything and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very close to a BART stop</span>. Bottom line: we hope to make The Mosser our hotel of choice for future trips to the city.</div><div class='text-box'>Loved the Mosser, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>great location</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>very accomodating</span> I went last minute to San Francisco to do the women's marathon. They had just had a cancellation so I booked it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The price was perfect</span>. I needed to be near the start line, which I was. It was very charming, not your usual impersonal hotel. It was clean and cozy. The restaurant was very accommodating to my needs for the race. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was close to shopping</span>, art museums and the race. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>I just took the bart from the hotel</span> and I was there, no need for a car or a taxi. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I would stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Would higly recommend the Mosser We really liked the Mosser. After a week of staying in motels the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>small sized room</span> in the Mosser was initially a bit of a shock. However, the hotel had provided everything we needed including a welcome pack, good value laundry and TV. We had shared bathroom facilities, but these were clean and we never had to wait to use them. All the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>staff were</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>friendly</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span>,and the hotel had a nice feel to it. The hotel is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>perfectly situated down town</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>within walking distance of all the shops</span>, cable cars and the coast. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>would</span> highly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>recommend</span> it.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Small, clean rooms</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful staff</span>. We stayed at the Mosser for just one night, but the hotel was clean and comfortable, although a little noisy as we were right across the hall from the ice machine. We stayed in a European style room, i.e. - no bathroom or shower, but for the price you really can't beat it. The bathroom and shower area were both clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is walking distance to</span> Union Square and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>lots of restaurants and shopping</span>. The rooms are quite small, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I'd highly recommend it if you just need a place to crash</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Loved This Place! The Mosser is a WONDERFUL hotel! We loved it! It was so close to Fisherman's Wharf and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>close to great shopping and restaurants</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This hotel staff is very</span> friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span>! Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was small</span>, but it was really cool! We even did the whole share a hall bathroom thing. it was fine and I never had to wait for the bathroom or the shower. no problem. Also the Mosser hotel gives to their enviromental charity. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>great place to stay</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>THE MOSSER IN SAN FRAN <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We thought the Mosser was just great</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff was very friendly and personable</span> compared to the service you get from one of those chains. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms were small indeed</span>, but comfortable and quiet and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Location is close to serveral types of public transportation and to nice restaurants</span> and bars. We'll definitely return!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Very Impressed</span> I was traveling by myself on a budget and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the Mosser was like staying at a 5 star hotel for only $62 p/night</span>. I stayed 4nights and never had to wait for the bathroom, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel room</span> and facilities were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very clean</span> and well presented. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great location so close to shopping and transport</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very smal, yet very clean.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff are extremely helpful and pleasant.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It is in a great area of San Fran, close to transit, shopping and restaurants.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">It was extremely easy to take the Bart from the airport to the hotel.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">I would recommend this hotel to friends who are on a budjet.</span></div></div>
