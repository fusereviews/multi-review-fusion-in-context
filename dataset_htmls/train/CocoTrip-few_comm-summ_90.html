<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I took a quick 3 day weekend trip to Toronto (my first trip there) with friends to see a ballgame and the Hockey Hall of Fame and take a quick tour of the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff</span> at the Grand <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was</span> very friendly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span> and attentive. Feeling welcome is very unusual in todays mega-chain hotels, but the Grand was top notch in that respect. Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features. Excellent free breakfast buffet, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym. Underground parking is expensive, $19.00 per night, but I was not charged. The neighborhood is very colorful, but if you want a sanitized version of a city, stay on the Las Vegas strip. You will feel safe anywhere you walk in Toronto, and Toronto is a city that should be walked to be experienced.</div><div class='text-box'>We were satisfied with our stay at this hotel. The service was very good, the hotel was clean, the breakfast was decent, and the rooms were just fine. The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe, nonetheless. A bit outside of the city center, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff were attentive</span> and very gracious. I would definitely stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a great deal online for <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a nice room with a beautiful view</span> - the small suite with a foldout couch was perfect for our family of four. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful</span>, with lots of tips for getting around. The location is not excellent - it's on the outskirts of downtown, and the neighborhood is a bit scary even for those of us from other large cities - but the hotel provides a free shuttle, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. All in all, a nice stay, and we'd go back.</div><div class='text-box'>I have just returned home from my Canadian Getaway. The hotel is fantastic and we have never experienced such incredible service before. Our room always looked spectacular, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>front desk staff was</span> always extremely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span>. We ate a couple meals at the hotel which were both great. I would recommend this restaurant and hotel to anyone travelling into Toronto or that even live in Toronto! I've visited Toronto many times and love the city, yet i've never wanted to stay in the hotel so much before. The roof top was beautiful at night or in the day. If you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to Toronto then this Hotel is an absolute must.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Grand hotel for 2 nights, and it was great. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Junior Suites were</span> clean, spacious, and very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>comfortable</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was</span> very friendly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span>, and accomodating. The location was excellent - steps away from the Eaton Centre and great shopping. We had a lovely complementary breakfast each morning including both hot and cold food. Complementary internet access was very useful in keeping in touch with family. We pretty much had the beautiful pool, whirpool, and locker room facilities to ourselves - also very clean. I will definitely be staying at the Grand hotel again.</div><div class='text-box'>The only complaint I have with this hotel is that the buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of the room, was lousy. Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, a great hotel with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>terrific service</span>. A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street. A good diner/grill/bar across the road. Despite the breakfasts, I'd stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Liked the hotel</span>, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms</span>, the pool, the hot tub on the roof. Location close to everything you need, but somehow the blocks surrounding the Grand Hotel are not the nicest area. I didn't feel safe there.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff was very helpfull</span> with directions around the city. Location was fine , We had no problems with anyone in the area despite what other people have said in their reviews.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The front desk staff of the hotel were helpful and the rooms are comfortable.</span></div></div>
