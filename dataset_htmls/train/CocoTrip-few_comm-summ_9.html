<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>If you are looking for complete peace, beauty, and relaxation away from the crazy commercialism of Cancun, this is the place. The resort is located only 45 minutes south of the Cancun airport and the resort will arrange for transportation to and from the airport for you. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff is very friendly and welcoming</span> and will go out of their way to assist you with whatever you may need. The property itself is very beautiful and landscaped throughout with lush gardens. It is as close to paradise as one can get. Mahekal is in walking distance of 5th Avenue (main strip for shopping, restaraunts, etc.) Mahekal has a wonderful wedding planner on staff who helped arrange everything for my wedding from the flowers to the hair dresser, photographer and priest. The resort and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beach is beautiful</span>, the food is outstanding, the people are extremely friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is completely relaxing. Without a doubt, this is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had and am looking forward to going back again this year.and hopefully many more to come.</div><div class='text-box'>A most relaxing holiday spot.the staff worked so hard to repair the hurricane damage,but in such a unobtrusive way that one's stay there was not impaired in the least.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The beach area was always tidy</span>,ample beds and shade,good service at all times and the room was directly facing the sand.blissful.I confess I didn't want to do anything but take to my sunbed,read,swim,bask and take refreshment.I felt secure there at all times;there was always an attendant around even at night but again without having a strong-arm presence.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel guests were obviously having a good time;the friendly approach of the dining attendants ensured this</span> at meal-times.The towels in the rooms were "sculptured" into an array of animals,with a new piece of artwork appearing at every room service. And as a final touch.on the morning of our departure,we were given a breakfast box;this contained appetising food and drink. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.a credit to Mexico and a jewel in the Yucatan!</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I really enjoyed the Mahekal - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff was</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly</span>, food was excellent, rooms very comfortable. This is a very low-key facility - rooms do not have TVs, radios or even clocks - but the beds are comfortable and the showers work well. We stayed in the Garden area which was quite nice - and still only a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>short walk to the beach</span>. Every room has a sheltered porch with two hammocks and a table and chairs. The location is near (a couple of blocks away) from the main shopping street. The beach is well maintained. All-in-all, a very nice place and a good value. A few complaints - could use better internet accessibility and some of the hotels in the area have music blasting a bit too loudly at times.</div><div class='text-box'>16 years and still coming back. It is such a fun, laid back, wonderfully relaxing place without a phone in your room or a tv blaring in your ear. Kids around the pool, adults talking, the sound of wind, waves, and yet it is quiet. Excellent staff, food, and you <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>sit next to the ocean</span> or inside comfort.it is not at all like an all inclusive, thank goodness. It is specially unique.</div><div class='text-box'>Clean hotel rooms, large tiled bathrooms, fans and air conditioning make for excellent cabana-like <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms</span>. Each <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>equipped with two hammocks for a lazy day at the beach</span>. The sand is clean and pure, the food is excellent (2 meals a day are inclusive) and the location is central to every shop, restaurant and anything else you could want. This is truely a diamond in the rough.</div><div class='text-box'>Can't say enough about this place. We spent five days there and didn't want to leave. The atmosphere enables you to truly escape the realities of life. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful</span>. We'll be back!</div><div class='text-box'>This is a great place to stay! Everything was perfect, from the gorgeous beach, 2 big pools, to the ping pong tables. Everyone can find something to enjoy! We loved it!</div><div class='text-box'>Terrific place to stay, quite, good food <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>unbelievable beach</span>. Close to shopping and restaurants. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff is the best, always happy and willing to help in any way</span>. .</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful and it is very close to the beach.</span></div></div>
