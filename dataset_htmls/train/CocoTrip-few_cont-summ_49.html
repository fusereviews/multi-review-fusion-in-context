<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the Locanda Sant'Agostin in January '06, we were very impressed with the quality and friendliness of the service we received. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Our room was very quiet</span>, if not <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a little cold</span>, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast was basic continental</span> style, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would recommend this hotel</span> to anyone who wants <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to experience Venice</span>, you really can walk anywhere from the Hotel, the Rialto Bridge and St Marks are only a few minutes walk away. A brilliant holiday - thank you Locando Sant'Agostin we'll be sending our parents your way next year!</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I, as well as another couple reserved 2 rooms on the internet and were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very happy with the accommodations</span>. They were clean, comfortable, charming, centrallly located, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast was</span> a nice start to the day with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>yoghurt, cappuccino, coissants, cereal</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were decorated with old world charm</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathrooms were newly upgraded</span>. The staff was very friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location was walking distance to all of Venice</span>. It is easiest to take a water taxi or the walk has many bridges and steps for you to navigate with your luggage. -Great value. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Loved Venice and Locanda Sant'Agostin</span> Loretta and Vincent</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel</span>; it is all about service and making sure the guests are comfortable. The staff are so helpful and so pleasant. We stayed in the apt nearby and found it spacious and clean, and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>gave us a flavour of how Venetians live</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is away from the main tourist drag but it is still in a great location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>not far from the water-ferry station and Rialto</span>,and quite close to a couple of great restaurants.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Locanda Sant'Agostin was a delight in every way</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is a historic beauty with a pleasant surprise of a large spacious room</span> and bathroom. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location was ideal</span>; situated off a quiet plaza but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>within easy walking distance to our destinations</span>.The staff was very friendly and helpful; their English speaking skills were somewhat limited but not problematic. Our stay was very pleasant and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I highly recommend this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the apartment next to the hotel which was spacious, comfortable and clean and a great price <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for Venice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast next door at the hotel</span> was lovely and the breakfast lady is very warm and friendly. The staff at reception could not have been more helpful, booking us tickets to a concert, recommending places to visit and restaurants to eat. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definitely come back and stay again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>A nice and friendly atmosphere. Everyone were very helpful in helping us with arrangement of a water taxi pickup early Sunday morning. It is located so you can easily (< 5 min) reach the places where the Venezians go out. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I am sure that we will consider this place, the next time we go to Venezia</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel was</span> ideally <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>located in the centre of Venice</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in a nice quiet situation</span>. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the hotel was spotlessly clean. I would <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>certainly recommend this hotel</span> and when I return to Venice will look no further.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>ideal place to stay right in the heart of real Venice</span> clean comfortable and elegant rooms very good breakfast very efficient and helpfull staff definetely i will stay again in my nxt visit</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The Locanda Sant'Agostin is the perfect hotel venue for a stay in Venice, highly recommended.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated in the centre of Venice and away from all of the usual tourist traps there.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are really quiet but somewhat cold.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">There was old-world charm to the room's decor but the bathrooms were modern as they had clearly been recently upgraded.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provided a basic Continental breakfast, with yoghurts, coffee, cereals and pastries.</span></div></div>
