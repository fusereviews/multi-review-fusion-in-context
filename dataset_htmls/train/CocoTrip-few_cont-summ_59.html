<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would NEVER Stay There Again</span> I booked this Queen as part of a package from Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. The flight (Delta) was packed but ok. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The room at the Queen REEKED of mold</span>. We couldn't get another room, they claimed to be 100% full (actually, they told us they always overbook 3-<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>5%).I took apart the air conditioner, cleaned out a bunch of black fungus/mold</span> and bought a can of Lysol at ABC store for $8.It helped a little, but not much.I called Pleasant, they claimed they couldn't help me and that I was better off at the counter.If you stay here, remember you're paying $50/night in a $150 neighborhood and that the facility is old, moldy, overbooked, and that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>they don't have much for customer service</span>.By the way, I think Pleasant Holidays is off my list too becase of their complete lack of support.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A Good Deal</span> Stayed for 4 nights and had a really good stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Friendly</span><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>helpful staff. Tour/Activities staff in lobby very knowledgeable</span>. Poor points are very limited parking and having to go to basement to get a pool towel from Housekeeping versus poolside on 3rd floor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>The AC units chill your room quickly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast buffet good deal for the money</span> and their dinners are just as good as any other restaurant. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Excellent location (beach, zoo, aquarium, shopping, etc)</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>easy to find</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>Rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>dated but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>and larger than you'd expect</span> for the price. I would definitely stay there again and plan to do so!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Getting Pretty Bad</span> Liike every one has said , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>are wonderful</span> , but then there's your room and the slow elevators. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms need a new face lift bad and the bathrooms are getting gross</span>, I went to have breakfast with my family, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a elevator they where leaving the restraunt by the time I got there. And the tile around the pool is VERY SLIPPERY, my grandchildren fell many times. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would recommend this hotel only if it's all you can afford</span> and you want to be close to the beach.</div><div class='text-box'>great hotel good value We stayed at Queen Kap for 11nights to the 09 sept 04. It was great we requested an ocean view studio with kitchenette. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3'>The room was on the 8th floor had a view of</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>diamond head, beach</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> pool</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3'>zoo</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>was old but clean and very comfortable</span>, and reasonably priced with every 5th night free and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>free buffets thrown in everyday too</span>! Check their websites for specials. We will be staying there again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>its old but good and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>staff are friendly</span> but request a room with a view and pay the extra! Mahalo</div><div class='text-box'>Wonderful Value - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Good for GLBT Customers If you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and the W Hotel, then this place is not for you</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>But, if you want a wonderful bargain right in the heart of Waikiki, this is great</span>! And if you are a GLBT customer, you are right next door to Hula's and across the street from Queen's Surf Beach. I would definitely stay again. I got a great deal too. Stay 3 nights and get the 4th night free.</div><div class='text-box'>Nice stay This was a pretty nice hotel. The location was great and very convenient. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>The amenities were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>nothing fancy, but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 7'>definitely adequate</span>. We got a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>balcony that overlooked the city and ocean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and a sizeable bathroom</span>; I couldn't really ask for more. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is definitely not a luxury palace</span>, but I doubt anyone booking this hotel expects that!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Can't Recomment</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>This hotel is in need of a big makeover</span>, standard rooms are really small, seems some motels have better rooms than their standard rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Service was good</span>, but thats about it for this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>happy with the Queen Kap</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>photo from our balcony</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is no luxury hotel but is okay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This is a perfectly located hotel if you wish to be near the zoo, aquarium and if you wish to go shopping.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It's easy to find and the view from the hotel is great as well.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel can be nice with views of the city or the ocean and even the zoo and even have good-sized bathrooms but other rooms have issues with smelling of mold and rooms and bathrooms in need of updating and cleaning.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Staffing at this hotel is okay.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">They are knowledgeable and friendly but not extraordinary.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">As part of your stay, a free buffet is on everyday for guests to help themselves.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">This hotel has adequate amenities.</span></div></div>
