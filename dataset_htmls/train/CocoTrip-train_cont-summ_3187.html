<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is great - one can actually see the hotel from the intersection outside of the Termini</span>. I stayed 4 nights in total - 2 nights on a Friday and Saturday and 2 nights at the end of the following week on Thursday and Friday. The room for the first 2 nights was unexpectedly spacious with high ceilings. Not what I expect for a Europe hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bed was very big</span>. The bathroom was lush with marble floors. The room for the last 2 nights were smaller than the first one despite at a more expensive rate. The bed was the same size as the bigger room. Overall, this is a modern hotel at a very good price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are</span> spacious and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>clean</span>, and the location is excellent.</div><div class='text-box'>My daughter and I just got back from a wonderful 9 day European trip, and our last city was Rome. We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and loved it. When we first checked in , Adel at the front desk was just wonderful. he was very helpful and nice, providing us with a map and suggesting restaurants close by. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location of the hotel is wonderful</span>. Lots of great cafe's and little shops within just a couple of block range from the hotel. Our room was on the top floor and we had a wonderful balcony. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The beds were comfortable</span> and the bathroom was by far the best we had while in Europe. I would definitely suggest this hotel to anyone going to Rome.</div><div class='text-box'>Enjoyed the hospitality of the Genova in November for 3 nights. Valentina and the staff were wonderful in helping us make arrangments for our group of 30. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were clean</span> and comfortable. No they were not large but were everything we needed for our stay. The Breakfast was exceptional! With good choices of pastries and eggs, fruit, coffee and juice. Just up the street from the Santa Maggiore and the Hop on Hop off bus stop - SO HANDY. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The street out front was noisy through the night</span> - but people - this is ROME . . . it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>is busy</span> and that is its charm. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Can hardly wait to go back again</span> and will recommend the Genova to anyone planning to visit Rome.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for four nights the staff were very friendly and helpful.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Room was kept clean</span> although not to big it was about normal for a city stay.We were at the front of the hotel so there was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a lot of traffic noise but not too bad overnight with window closed(there</span> was air-con) The breakfast was very nice and a good start to the day.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is only 5 minute walk from main station</span> and bus station so easy to get around.Just up the road from the collassium surprising how close things are together.There are some nice places to eat near by if you don't want to wander to far in the evenings after a long day. We had a wonderful time although beware with the euro it is expensive.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the Genova in February 2004. I was traveling alone and was glad <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel was centrally located to the termini</span> and alot of the important monuments and site-seeing areas. There was a good variety of cuisine as well. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The rooms were clean</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> but in need of redecorating</span> [<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>somewhat depressing atmosphere</span>, but I really didn't spend alot of time in mine], the breakfast was boring after the first morning, and the hotel staff wasn't very helpful, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>all in all, this hotel got the job done</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hotel Genova in September 07. I had read some mixed reviews about the hotel and did have doubts in my mind. However, I could not have been more wrong! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>hotel was clean and tidy, with modern finishes</span>. The breakfast was good and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the room</span> and bathroom <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was perfect</span> (small as most European rooms are). The hotel was a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>short walk from the train station</span> and about a 15 minute walk to the Spanish Steps. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>would recommend this hotel</span> to anyone and would stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We staied at the Hotel Genova for a week and and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we had absolutely a lovely stay</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Our room was</span> very spacious and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>spotless</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bed was big and very confortable</span>. Although we got there way before check in time the receptionist did her best and managed to give the room earlier than expected. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is located just minutes walk from Termini train and bus station</span> and within walking distance from the Colosseum. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I would definitly reccomend the hotel Genova</span>, both for business and leisure stay.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>The location is central</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> a 5 min walk from the roma termini</span>, very easy to locate, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the hotel was nice and clean</span>. However <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the room was</span> quiet small and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>very noisy specially at night</span>, could clearly hear a metro train rumble by every half an hour or so. the breakfast was nice too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Overall the hotel was good value for money</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is situated near the Roma Termini Railway station, so its a good location if you need to take the train in the morning.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated on a very busy street, so unless you get a room at the back of the hotel or on a high floor, you will be disturbed by the traffic all through the night.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is definitely NOT cosy and gives a sterile and cold impression.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room was clean and the bed was OK</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">but it was very dark.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Additionally, there was a strange odor of perfume in the room.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">All in all, we will not return to this hotel and one night was enough.</span></div></div>
