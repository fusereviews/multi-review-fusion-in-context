<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed here over Memorial Day weekend 2012. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I think this</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 8'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>is a steal if you catch it on an off-season weekend</span> when the prices are lower. In any event, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side</span>. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The complimentary breakfast was great</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the welcome drinks were a nice touch</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Love the courtyard and pool - very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious</span>. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>there's no housekeeping after midnight</span>, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done</span>. But otherwise <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>the service was outstanding</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'> especially</span> Shawn <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>at the front desk</span>. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel le Marais</span> for four nights and loved it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>This modern, boutique</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>was clean and well-maintained</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5'>The beds were heavenly</span>!<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor</span>, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>The staff was extremely helpful</span>, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the hotel is that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Being able to walk to key landmarks, check out local art galleries</span> and antiques, and grab a beignet was a huge plus! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Other hotel perks: free drinks per guest, free bottled water in the room</span>, 15% off our stay, and chocolates and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>ginger snaps in the lobby.</span></div><div class='text-box'>This hotel is in the very heart of the French Quarter. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>It</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is</span> new, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>has good facilities</span>. WiFi, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>breakfast</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a very well equipped business centre</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>was free</span> (normally charged for at other hotels), so I felt like I had good value for money. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 6 7'>The staff were friendly</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>and helpful</span>. As <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel has only just opened</span>, there were a few very small teething problems in the area of service, but I am sure this will be sorted out in no time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I would definitely stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>3 couples - friends for 30+ years, vacationing together for the first time. The hotel was fabulous - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>the rooms were clean</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>beds were incredibly comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The pool area was lovely</span> and a wonderful way to end the evening. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The location - perfect walking distance to everything</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>The staff pleasant and professional</span>. My husband and I had been to the French Quarter 15 years earlier and we begged our friends to share this experience with us. Thank you for making this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a most memorable experience</span> for us.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The hotel is located less than one block off of Bourbon St</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>in the heart of the French Quarter</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>service was outstanding</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5'>accommodations were clean</span> and comfortable. It was a pleasure to stop after a full day on the road, enjoy some hot food and relax. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The courtyard</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was very nice</span> and relaxing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>Everyone from the front desk to the general manager made us feel welcomed and comfortable</span>. Well done!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Beautifully remodeled</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>in the perfect location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Very clean</span> and very quiet - unbelieveable since <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it's only 1/2 block off Bourbon Street</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6 7'>The staff was excellent</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bar was a nice</span> quiet retreat and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the courtyard is charming</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We will definitely stay here again</span> on our next trip to NOLA!</div><div class='text-box'>Our room was very nice, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the service was excellent</span>.
