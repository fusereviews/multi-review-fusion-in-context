<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>1. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Strathcona is right in the heart of Toronto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Everything was at hand</span> 2. I am used to the European Hotel of "getting the arm in" for a safe deposit box. Therefore it was a great enhancement that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the safe deposit box was pro bono</span> 3. The staff and the concierge was more than helpful. Well done & thank you 4. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were lovely & clean & well maintained over our four night stay</span> 5. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The rooms were bijou</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> however we were comfortable</span> because my wife & I are slim. If you are a disgusting big rotund(s); either lose weight or get another hotel 6. I would definitely stay here again</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel was not cheap - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>almost 200 Canadian dollars (including tax and a buffet breakfast) per night</span> for a standard room. We were shocked by the so-called "<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>standard" room</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'> It</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>was tiny</span>: to do some ironing on the ironing board, or to have access to the electric power points, one literally had to move the furniture around. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Cupboard space was inadequate</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The shower was lukewarm</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>only redeeming featrure was the location</span>: not in an attractive part of Toronto, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>at least within walking distance of the CN Tower</span> and the main railway station. I thought it was exceptionally bad value for money, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>would not recommend it</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location of this hotel is its best attribute</span>. I was in Toronto for an Argos football game August 12 and stayed at the Strathcona (for the second time). I paid $83USD for a Friday night. This is cheap by downtown T.O. standards. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The room was small</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and clean with no view at all, but I did not care</span> because I was noe in town for the view or the size of the room. Parking is two blocks down Wellington St. and cost $15CDN for a night - again not bad by T.O. standards. Overall a perefectly serviceable hotel if you are looking for a clean room in a great location.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This place is located right center to all the places we wanted to see</span>. My friend and I went to see a concert and when I called to book <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>they were the only hotel I found who did not talk down to you about not owning a credit card</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>They are in walkin distance from the train station, the cn tower, hockey hall of fame and the AC and the rogers center</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was amazing and being that we were first timers in a hotel they didn't make ya feel like any question was too stupid</span>. I am going back to toronto and I am staying there again!</div><div class='text-box'>Pros: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Good location</span> Affordable Cons: Hotel staff (see below) While our stay started out well, it turned into a disaster by the end. We were situated across from about 2-4 rooms of American college students who were in Toronto to drink heavily, smoke and make as much noise as they possible could. Despite numerous calls to the front desk to remedy the problem, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>they did absolutely nothing to help</span>. We had two sleepless nights & this put a major damper on what was otherwise a fantastic trip. My advice: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Pay the extra money & stay somewhere else!</span></div><div class='text-box'>My husband and me came for the Monster truck show at Rogers Center on Jan. It was super fun. What the hotel lacks in amenities and services they make up for it by being centralized. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Near to the night-club scene, sports arenas; Rogers Center/Air Canada Center</span>. Restaurants, theater, shopping, and best of all, being cheap cheap cheap. Did I mention cheap? The weekend was fun and exciting. Thanks Gravedigger for tarin' the place up!</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the Strathcona while attending the Toronto Film Festival this past weekend. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>If there are only two in your party, this is a very cozy hotel</span>. Our room was very comfortable and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location was great</span>. You are one block away from the train terminal and the Airport Express shuttle picks you up right across the street. I would definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>I booked a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Deluxe Room</span> which to be honest <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was worse than Basic</span> Rooms i have stayed in, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>in other Hotels</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Buffet Breakfast was expensive</span> and we ate at other places. Pub was fine though if you like watching Sport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Ideal location though for Attractions</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel treated first time stayers with respect.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location of the hotel couldn't be better because there are nearby attractions, night-clubs, and popular sights within walking distance.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Even the deluxe rooms in the hotel are not to be recommended.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are small with poor storage.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The showers are lukewarm and the hall is noisy with rowdy guests at all hours.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Unfortunately the buffet breakfast didn't come cheaply but it the food was mostly fine.</span></div></div>
