<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is situated at around 10 min by cab from the center</span> (barrio gotico). Must be max 10 years old. Can be reached also by tram or metro. Rooms are clean, beds a bit hard. Bar is OK and the patio too but mostly in the shadom in the evening. Rooms that had a sea view don't have it anymore (see previous reviews). A bit expensive for the location and the lack of view (my room had a view on a skeleton building (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all). The pool on the 17th is not heated, so quite difficult to swim at this time of the year, nice view on the utility building on the other side and on the sea and beach, plus power plant for the rest.</div><div class='text-box'>The rooms and prices looked good and the pool looked attractive online, however the reality was different. I booked a family room which is really 2 separate bedrooms next to each other behind another door for privacy which was meant to lock but didn't. My kids room smelt like someone had smoked 100 cigarettes in it and had drugs and booze on the table when we checked in. They cleaned but the smell didn't go away for all 3 days and they would not change the rooms. The pool is tiny and over crowded with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. Well done for offering free WiFi but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating. Overall it is good value but it is most suited to weekend getaways for young party couples or mates.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the diagonal zero for 4 nights while attending a congress. The area near the hotel is not nice, however, the metro station is nearby and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>you can visit the centre in a few minutes</span> The rooms are spacious, mattress is moderate, views are poor. The decoration is modern but on the poor side. Breakfast was ok, but i consider it unacceptable to drink disgusting coffee from a machine in a 4 star hotel.it shows lack of respect for the client. The Personnel was very polite. There is a very good gym in the hotel and free wifi which is very important.</div><div class='text-box'>We only stayed one night but had most of 2 days sightseeing in Barcelona with fairly grown up family in 2 bedrooms. Hotel happy to look after our luggage. Perhaps <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in an area a bit far from the character of Barcelona, but very convenient for tram and subway</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Also large shopping centre close by with lots of dining choice</span>. Pool a bit crowded as our trip was in the heat of August and slightly disappointing that they charged for towel use. Very helpful porter showed us control panel for lights/aircon etc - all very hi-tech.</div><div class='text-box'>Recently stayed here and was very impressed with this hotel. Friendly staff, good clean rooms and quiet so sleep no problem. The beach is with 10 mins walking distance from the hotel and 5 mins walk from a great shopping mall Diagonal Mar where there are lots of great restaurants. The metro is a 2 min walk and a 10 min journey or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>6 stops to the centre of the city</span> with no changes. We loved it!</div><div class='text-box'>I stay for 3 nights in a business trip, the hotel is beautiful and the room was suburb. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Its far from the city town</span> but have the beach nearby and a subway station pretty close. For sure I will come back again</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for five nights at this hotel for a conference. By the end we couldn't wait to leave due to the monotonous breakfast, below par cleanliness, and cold decor.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wonderful hotel just a short metro ride away from</span> Barcelona <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>attractions</span>, with gorgeous rooftop pool. Excellent customer service.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The location of the hotel is near to the city centre.</span></div></div>
