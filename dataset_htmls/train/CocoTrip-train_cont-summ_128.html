<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>My friend and I stayed here in late march for 7 nights and loved it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The hotel is located very close to</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the arc de triumphe</span>, air France bus stop and CDG Etoile <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>metro station</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful</span>. the breakfasts had the basics and was ok for 12. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>We stayed in a club twin room which was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>small but very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>clean</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The beds were very comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and bathroom clean and modern (with a pretty good hair dryer).</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We did hear a bit of noise from the street</span> on a few occasions as there is a cinema across the road but nothing that disturbed us too much. We also heard a tv from another night once but otherwise no noise from other rooms. I would definitely recommend it and would stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The staff here were very helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>The rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>lovely and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>good shower pressure and very comfy</span>. They were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>not very big</span> as is typical in Paris. The breakfasts were good and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the location was just behind the Arc De Triomphe. From here you can explore The Champs Elysee</span>, The Arc, Palais Royal, The Invalides and more- and the shopping is pretty good too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There is a Metro 2 minutes walk away</span>. It is The Charles De Gaulle which is a central line. We found the Metro easy to use and a brilliant way to move around the city. It is worth the walk from here to The Laduree Salon- a beautiful tearoom. Try the 4 berry tea with and the macaroons. 6 Euro for a pot but you can share. Yumm</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel at the beginning of our trip and since we were flying out of Paris again decided to rebook when we returned <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we loved it so much</span>. The location of the hotel is wonderful just near the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. That being said <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the hotel</span> itself <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>is in a quite street that does not have a lot of</span> traffic that could cause <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>noise</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were lovely and were always very helpful</span>. We arrived and upgraded both times, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the room</span> we had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was</span> on the 5th floor and amazing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There was so much space</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very clean</span> and well planned out. We thought the hotel was just wonderful and were very happy to go back!</div><div class='text-box'>We loved this hotel for the location and the hotel itself. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>It is just a few short blocks from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees,</span> which is a direct line to all of the other beautiful sights of Paris. It is also close to restaurants, cafes and neighborhood shops. The hotel itself was clean, very comfortable, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the staff was very helpful</span> and courteous. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We have stayed at other hotels</span> in Paris, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but the Royal Magda was the best experience of all</span>. The rooms were modern, quiet, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the beds were comfortable</span>. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, the price was also very reasonable, especially for Europe. Enjoy!</div><div class='text-box'>Having read all the reviews on Tripadvisor, we choose Hotel Royal Magda. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel is convenient for the Metro and RER line at Charles de Gaule Etoile, which is a five minute walk</span>. You do not need to be overly energetic to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>walk to the Champes Elysee</span>, and the Eiffel Tower is probably twenty minutes walk from the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is small</span> with no more than 40 rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in turn small but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The hotel resides in a side street</span> just of the main boulevard Wagram <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>which helps reduce noise</span> etc. The price is very reasonable and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we enjoyed our stay.</span> Recommended.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the deluxe suite of Royal Magda Etoile in the end of January 2010, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we certainly enjoyed our stay</span>. The hotel was very quite. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The rooms</span> and the bathroom <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were very spacious</span> (more than adequate for 3 adults). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Everything</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>comfortable</span>. There was really high speed internet connection in the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The personnel were very friendly and helpful</span>. The breakfast buffet was complete. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The hotel is only 1 min walking distance from</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the Arc de Triomphe</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the metro station</span>. The taxi from and to the airport (ChDG) cost about 40-45 euro.</div><div class='text-box'>We just returned from 4 nights in Paris where we stayed at the Hotel Magda. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The experience was very nice</span> as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>tiny</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very clean</span> as was also the bathroom. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We marvelled at the comfortable bed</span> and were appreciative of the quiet street that let us sleep after a day of exhausting but exhilarating sight seeing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The location is right near</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the Metro</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the L'arc Du Triomphe and the Champs Elysees</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were very polite and friendly</span> as well as professional. We enjoyed our stay for our first visit to Paris.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 4 nights at the Royal Magda hotel and for the price, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we were extememely pleased</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms were small</span> but clean, same with the bathroom. Since we didn't come to Paris to stay in the room, it was perfect. The location was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>within walking distance to the Champes Elysee</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the subway was a block away</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Everyone at the hotel was polite and helpful</span>. Would definitely stay there again</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">We had a very nice stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a boutique style hotel, so the rooms are on the small side, but has everything you need to make your stay comfortable.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff, Lilly and Mila, were very helpful and friendly.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The metro is within walking distance to the hotel.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">You can walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees from the hotel.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The only issue is that in some of the rooms there is a lot of noise, which is coming from a club which is located across the street from the hotel.</span></div></div>
