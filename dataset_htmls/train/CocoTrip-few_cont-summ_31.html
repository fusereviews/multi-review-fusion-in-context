<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Hotel Victoria is great as a base from which to see the city. It's on Yonge Street, bonus, and is reasonably priced. Things like CN Tower, Rogers Centre/Skydome, the Eaton Centre, harbourfront, Hockey Hall of Fame, Union station and Dundas Square are all between 5 and 20 minutes' walk. A list of good food options in the area would have the 'Richtree market restaurant' at the top (it's also one of the closest), nice 'takesushi' place around the corner, Baton Rouge closer to Dundas square. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. You don't choose hotel victoria because you want luxury, nice thick walls that block out most noise, or a view of anything but a brick wall (in our room anyway), but like i said <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>it has friendly staff</span>, is reasonably priced and is in a great location.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a decent deal online by having to show our concert ticket to Bon Iver at Massey Hall. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>The queen room was</span> small but nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>recently updated</span>, the hotel was in a great location about a ten minute walk to Queen street and only a few minutes from the GO station / Union. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We paid a little extra for the "Business Room" which came with</span> a bottle of water - although there was no fridge, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a paper in the morning and Apple TV</span>, which was a good to have after the show. The only faults: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we were a disappointed when we asked downstairs for wine glasses on our way in</span>, as we brought a bottle for after the show; and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the pillows were a bit high/full</span> for us - pretty minor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast down in the adjoining restaurant, Over Easy was great in the morning</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>stayed here for three nights. they are renovations going on at the moment in the lobby but don't let that put you off - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we were on 2nd floor - newly renovated and didn't hear a thing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms are contemporary (new new blue woodedn floor)</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean rooms</span> but be careful as bath in slippery - they have a bath mat for you to use. would have been nice if there were a few leaflets on site seeing in toronto - there was only a niagara leaflet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Must eat in Over Easy - restaurant just walk through hotel lobby - they do breakfast/lunch from 10am-4pm. the french toast and side of fresh fruit is magic</span>. would recommend this hotel - hockey hall of fame is 5 minute walk - CN tower 15 mins and downtown shopping in yonge is a ten minute walk.</div><div class='text-box'>My girlfriend and I are staying here late November on an extended business trip. (for the first time) Before we have even stayed there, I can say I am <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>more than satisfied with the service at this Hotel</span>. I sent an email to the Sales Manager with a couple of questions about the hotel and he got back to me with polite answers\suggestions in a timely manner. This is officially the first time I have ever written a review before I have stayed somewhere. Looking forward to our experience there.</div><div class='text-box'>Best hotel stay I've ever had! Every year my boyfriend and I celebrate our anniversary by having a hotel night, our normal hotel was unavaliable so we looked around and immediatly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fell in love with the modern decor of these rooms</span>. The location was amazing, having Netflicks avaliable to us as well was wonderful, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel staff were very very nice</span>! I think my boyfriend and I have found a new hotel for our future anniversaries! To sum up my experience: it was amazing!</div><div class='text-box'>Location is perfect, just on Yonge and Wellington (close to Eaton centre for shopping and CN Tower Skydome for sightseeing). Althouigh, the breakfast was an extra cost (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>there is an over easy in the hotel</span>), this was quite good value for money and a good way to start the day. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>free wi-fi in the rooms</span> was a God send. Room was nice and the shower was really good. I would definitely recommend people to stay here.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed over thr weekend and was VERY <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>impressed with the quality of service(friendly staff</span>) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the great room (really clean</span>). I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>heard that they will be renovating</span> in the near future and will make another reservation to see what the results are. Highly recommended</div><div class='text-box'>Convenient location downtown. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The staff were courteous and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was modern</span> and suited our needs for a one night rental.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel are really modern and well kept.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">There is also free WiFi in the room .</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">If you pay a little extra for the business room, you get Apple TV and a paper in the morning.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">One thing to mention is that perhaps the pillows were a bit too full.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">All members of staff were really helpful; from the Sales Manager to Housekeeping everybody was friendly and performed their jobs to a high standard.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has an adjoining restaurant called Over Easy which serves great food.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has recently been newly renovated and as a result there was no sound disturbances on the second floor.</span></div></div>
