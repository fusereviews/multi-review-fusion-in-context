<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great Room.Great Location.Great Service! Great Room.Great Location.Great Service! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms</span> have been updated and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>are clean</span> and comfortable. The location is extremely close to most bus routes that will take you everywhere in the city. All bus stops are within walking distance from the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It is also walking distance to many neighborhood eating and drinking establishments</span> which are clearly loved by the locals. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The folks who work at the motel are extremely friendly and willing to help</span> with directions and city recommendations. Best of all, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>there is no charge for parking</span> - this is truly something when talking about a location in San Francisco! Many would consider this a no-frills motel; however, I consider it true hidden treasure!</div><div class='text-box'>Lovely place Stayed at La Luna Inn and it was just like the website shows - the pictures were of the room not just the best rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Its on</span> Lombard <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>street which is a busy street, we stayed in the back part which was nice and quiet</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was very clean</span> and had nice fresh decor, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff were helpful</span> and the room serviced every day. There are also security cameras in the corridors which makes you feel safe.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>You can walk down to the Marina through some lovely streets</span> which is about a 7 minute walk and get some nice views of the Golden Gate bridge.I would definetely recommend this hotel to other travellers. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The free parking is great</span> too.</div><div class='text-box'>Ok for the price Stayed for 3 nights before moving on to LA. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel was located at the Golden Gate bridge end of Lombard Street</span> about 30 minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There was a lot of traffic noise</span> from our front facing room which may bother some people but we didn't find it much of a problem. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms where clean</span> and the decor looked quiet modern. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The beds where comfortable</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span>. Breakfast was very basic and served in reception. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There are lots of trendy bars and restaurants close</span> by and the area seemed very safe.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Overall a fairly cheap motel style hotel</span> where we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>would stay again if the price was right</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Great budget stay</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>in San Francisco</span> The La Luna Inn was a highlight of our stay in the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beds comfortable, staff friendly and helpful</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>there is free parking</span>. It was safe and we were lucky to have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It is 30 minutes by public bus from the big attractions</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the street can be noisy</span> so look at a map before you book. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>But, good restaurants and shopping nearby</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Overall, an excellent stay that I would recommend to friends</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Perfect Budget Honeymoon</span> We had a great experience at La Luna. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff were friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was immaculately clean</span>, the furnishings and decor simple and beautiful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bed comfy</span>. We did take previous reviewers advice and ask for a quiet room in the back. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There were many very good little restaurants one street over on Chestnut</span> and it was a pretty walk to the Exploratorium and a pretty hike to Fisherman's wharf. Just our style for our budget honeymoon and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we plan to come back</span> for our anniversary next year.</div><div class='text-box'>The Place is Loud! You get what you pay for! I actually stayed here after reading the reviews. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The place is in the Marina area</span> so it is in a good location, HOWEVER, it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>right on Lombard street</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>basically like a SF Freeway</span>). So it is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>extremely loud</span> unless you are in the back. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beds are comfortable</span>, the showers are horrible, and the carpeting is industrial. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>would hesistate to stay</span> there <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Did the Job</span>! We were a little unsure before heading to the hotel but when we arrived we were greeted with some <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very friendly and helpfull reception staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was</span> rather basic but very tidy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>reasonably comfortable</span>. If you are looking for basic and in a good location this place works. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>In good walking distance to</span> the Golden gate bridge and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the Marina</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Highly recomended</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>great find</span> We had a pleasant stay at La Luna Inn. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was</span> large and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the beds were comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff was helpful</span>, the continental breakfast was a convenient way to start a day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The parking was free</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The price was a little over $100</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We'll definately stay there again</span>. Los Angeles</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Good value.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The property is located off a busy street, and yes there is considerable noise.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">However, the hotel room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room rate was pretty reasonable for a stay in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">We were in walking distance to Chesnut street which is where all the great bars and restaurants are in the Marina.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The free parking was also a great help considering there is no parking in the city.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Would stay again.</span></div></div>
