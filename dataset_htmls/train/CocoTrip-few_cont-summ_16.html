<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Okay after all the rave reviews of other guests I was expecting amazing. Guaranteed we had the crapiest weather over the NYE period, but we had paid for a package deal and half of what we paid for we never saw, they took some money off the final bill but even still what was outlined in our package was not included. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were aloof</span>; one gentleman behind the counter was very approachable however the rest were rather aloof. The room was probably the smallest we had stayed in ad had a slanting roof which proved extremely difficult to move around as you were continually hunched over. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff were not overly interested in what you did and in informing you of anything to do or see</span>, which was quite disappointing after the fantastic experiences we had had in Rome and Florence. Maybe this is the service you receive when you go to Flashy hotels and if this is the case then I am happily never going to a fancy hotel again - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>midrange hotels for me (better value for money</span>)</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I returned to this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>superbly placed hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>a wonderful four day break</span>. (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>100 metres from St Marco</span>). Right from the start, whilst making my reservation by phone, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Jacopo made me feel welcome</span>, and this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>wonderful service contiued throughout</span> our stay. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>resturant for breakfast is right on the lagoon</span> and to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>sit outside in the sunshine</span> and start your day <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>with a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>plentiful multi choice breakfast</span> is a pure joy. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>lovely Hotel helped make our trip to this very special city all the more enjoyable</span>. Our <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was</span> not large but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>perfectly equipped</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 8'>A Lagoon view would have made it even better</span> (maybe next time) I am sure there will be a next time, and definately at Savoia and Jolanda.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights in January 2004 as part of our honeymoon and we loved it. We did request a balcony room as recommended on trip advisor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>It was beautiful a perfect view of the grand canal</span>. It s location was perfect <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>three doors away from the bridge of Sighs and 200 m from St. Marks Square</span>. The room was plush , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>exposed beams, tastefully decorated</span> but a bit disappointed that there was no bath in the bathroom. and room (or suite as it was called) was small by suite standards.1 room.(Bed with a couch and table) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend it if you wanted to splash out for a special occassion it is a bit pricey</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>In the middle of everthing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>St. Marks</span>, Museums, anf fine restarants. I really believe I could spend the rest of my life in this most beautiful city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The hotel and staff are magnificent</span>. We have stayed there on two separate trips now and look forward to the third soon. My wife just loves to get lost waling the canals and alleways. Wonderful breakfast at the hotel as well. Steps away fro the San Zaccaria vaparetto stop.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is very conveniently located from the San Marco stop and faces the Grand Canal. The staff were not necessarily friendly, but they were not rude either. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>They were helpful in giving us</span> information and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>directions</span> as well as storing our luggage after checkout so we could explore a bit before our scheduled time of departure. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>We were pleasantly surprised when we returned after dinner to find turn down service and chocolates on our pillows</span> :-)</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>what</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>a beautiful place looking out onto the St giorgio magiore church island</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>The rooms with views are quite expensive.but venice is a precious place</span> with very little space. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the restaurant is good (especially the free breakfast).but</span> explore the many small trattorias, restaurants, and pannini bars.for much better though. the best value compared to cipriani, hilton danelli etc.would highly recommend</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Definately the best bed i've slept</span> during our vacation, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>rooms immaculates</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7 8'>wide choice at the restaurant</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>for breakfast(homemade cakes</span>!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 8'>More then central position facing the san marco basin.5</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>stars</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>The location was great and the employees were very helpful.My ronn did not have a great view but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it was very beautifuly decorated</span>.I was on the second floor facing an alley.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel made the trip feel special but it was a little more expensive than your standard places.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel looks out onto the Saint Giorgio Maggiore .</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">It is very close to the Bridge of Sighs and St. Mark's Square.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Rooms with a good view are quite expensive but it is tastefully decorated with exposed beams.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">There are lovely touches such as turn-down service and chocolates left on the pillow.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are perfectly equipped and include a couch and table.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">During a visit to this hotel the staff provided directions when required.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's restaurant is situated on the lagoon and there is a varied selection for breakfast.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The stay was good but a lagoon view could make the experience even better.</span></div></div>
