<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I have stayed here three times -all on business trips where the hotel was booked for me. In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The two lifts are small and infrequent, and so you may have to wait a long time</span> - which is annoying if you are on the top floors. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is great for seeing Barcelona</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>-you can reach most of the central sights by foot -including the Gaudi cathedral</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Very near to a metro line</span> , which is also a bonus. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4 9'>Rooms are fine</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 9'>-just try to get one facing the courtyard at the back -the ones to the front can be noisy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>Biggest disappointment was the breakfast -17 for a very poor selection - definitely not worth it</span>. I didn`t bother after the first morning.</div><div class='text-box'>We got <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a really good deal on the rooms at this hotel</span> and, therefore, it was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>worth what we paid for it</span>. However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I would have been dissapointed if we had payed full price for this</span>. We went in january which I know is not in season however, the terraces were closed and the pools were not open. They were also doing refurbishment works to one of the terraces, none of this was really communicated until you checked in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was a reasonable size</span> as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The bathrooms however, need some updating</span>, they were tired and not in the best condition. Also be warned <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 9'>if you stay on the front of the hotel, the spanish like to beep their horns and this can be disturbing</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'></span></div><div class='text-box'>Second time in this hotel and kinda disappointed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Rooms are ok</span> and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is a good value for money mainly due to the great location</span> on Paseig de Gracia, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the service does not seem to care so much about their customers</span>. They are physically present behind the desk, but it stops here. It seems that they are breathing boredom. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If you go to Barcelona for a short weekend and do not plan to spend too much time at the hotel, it'll be alright</span>. If not, i'm sure you can pick a better place where the service will show you a more positive and customer focused attitude.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The hotel staff was very helpful</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>rooms very modern with everything that we could think of</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>It is a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>short walk away from Gaudi's Casa Batllo</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'> la Pedrera and a bit longer to la Sagrada Familia</span>, the location couldn't be better! Within a couple of blocks it has many restaurants to chose from and can't forget to mention that it's in a great shopping area. From now on <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the place where we'll stay when visiting Barcelona</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>! i can only think of a few things wrong with our stay, for one, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>breakfast was not worth the price paid</span> and room service was a bit overpriced as well, but with such a wide variety of other places to eat <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in barcelona</span>, it didn{t really mattter much. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The standard room was small but</span> then again <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the bed was huge</span>! and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the location</span>. it ca<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>n't get eny better</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is located in a great location however is very expensive</span>. If your looking for a place near Gaudi's buildings and shopping areas, then stay here.</div><div class='text-box'>A lovely pillow menu.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>WOW.rooms excellent.location</span> is very central and many many shops near the hotel, staff very helpful. A bit pricey but Lovely</div><div class='text-box'>Great place and location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would defo stay here again</span>. Loved it. Go see it.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel, although a tad expensive, is a good option for a short stay in Barcelona.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The front of the hotel can be noisy at time so ask for a room that is not facing the street.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is situated near a metro line to get into central Barcelona.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel itself is a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and just a little further to see La Sagrada Familia.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are okay though on the small side at times.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Bathrooms needed updating and some TLC but overall the rooms are good value due to the hotel's location.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's staff was really very helpful.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's breakfast was a bit basic and expensive for a 4 star hotel .</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The lifts in the hotel are a bit cramped and can take some time to arrive.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The best rooms in the hotel are the ones facing the courtyard at the back, as the front side of the hotel can be noisy.</span></div></div>
