<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I traveled here for business for the first time and was somewhat disappointed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There is only wireless internet service in most of the rooms, which I can not use with my office laptop for security reasons. I had to switch rooms in order to have high speed internet access. and the internet service seemed to work only some of the time. The connection wasn't working consistently and nobody in the hotel could help.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>They offered a toll free number for the tech people at the DSL company. The front desk failed to provide me with my mini-bar key</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack in it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>There were many many tourists in the hotel, which isn't good for business travelers because they tend to make a lot of noise.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>I don't think I'll travel here again unless I am a tourist</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I stay at this hotel very frequently, and every single time, my experience has been fabulous. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The hotel is right in the downtown area</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>5 min. walk from South Station</span> which really helps me as I frequently take the train from/to New York. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>The rooms are really nice</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> bathrooms and linen really</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>clean</span> and above all else, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff is some of the most friendly I have ever come across</span>, rifht from the front desk to the concierge and housekeeping. Samir Boukhari, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>front desk manager</span> is delightfully courteous and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>has always gone out of his way to help</span> and make my stay very comfortable every single time. Dianna, Aruna and Lexi at the front desk and Anthony with the concierge are wonderful as ever. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>I would stay here as long as business/pleasure keeps taking me into Boston</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>for business.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>It was in a great location, close to the theater district, shopping</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> etc</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>There is only one restaurant and a very small bar in the hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>It would have been nice to have additional options</span>. There were restaurants close by, but again, it would have been nice to have had the convenience of additional dining places. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The fitness center was so so</span>. I was very disappointed that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>there was a charge for internet</span>. When paying the price we paid per night, that should have been included in the room cost. Great concierges.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Boston for one night during Memorial Day weekend. The staff was great, we were upgraded to a Terrace Suite when we checked in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It was beautiful and very clean</span>/pleasant, although you can't actually go out onto the Terrace so that was bittersweet. We ordered room service which was excellent! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast buffet was wonderful</span> as well! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great location to all of Boston</span>. Overall a great trip! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Will return to this hotel whenever we are in Boston</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>When we booked this hotel we were worried because we saw more negative reviews than good at that time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I have no complainst.the staff was very helpful</span>, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>in house restaurant was excellent</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>the rooms were very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Very close to Macy</span>'<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>s, TJ Maxx and Marshall's</span>. . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>.walking distance to all other sites</span> that we wanted to see. . . The only thing I can say negatively is paying for WIFI but that is a problem with all hotels.</div><div class='text-box'>hi, i have read all the reviews and they are a bit mixed.We have just stayed there n i have to say it 's great.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Its a central location</span> - we hired a car and left it back 4 days early as parking is so expensive-unless u have to dont hire a car-otherwise park it in the place out in front of the hotel its the cheapest we checked them all i have the sore feet to prove it!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Disappointing when hotels such as this still charge for wifi access</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We didn't get notified verbally about the complimentary breakfast</span> either although it was no doubt in the fine print somewhere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Rooms were nice and clean</span> although a little boring and the bed not that comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Can't fault the location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>it</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 3'>was very easy to get anywhere</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>with the subway station a few hundred metres away</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great location</span> and greater service at this Hyatt in Boston. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>No more convient place to stay</span>. Came in by train and never needed to have a car. You are right in the middle of everything! The hotel & service is top notch and this isn't my first stay in Boston!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a convenient place to stay, whether business or pleasure.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is beautiful and clean and is ideal for repeat stays.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's location is really good because there are shopping destinations and theatres nearby.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">In addition there is a subway station that isn't too far away.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel are perfectly adequate, in particular the bathroom and linen.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Extremely friendly and helpful at all times.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There is a complimentary breakfast here, which you may not be informed about when arriving.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">It would have been good to have had more food options in the one restaurant the hotel has here.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">Like many hotels, there is a charge to use the Wi-Fi here</span><span id="9" class="summary-sentence">, however there is a fitness centre facility on site for guests to use if they so wish.</span></div></div>
