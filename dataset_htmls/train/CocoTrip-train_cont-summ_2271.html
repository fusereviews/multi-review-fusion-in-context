<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This hotel had the kindest staff ever. They were genuinely kind and helpful.They'll help you get around the city and suggest good and affordable restaurants to eat in. But more than that, they really go out of their way to make you feel at home. When they found out it was my dad's birthday, they actually bought him a cake. This family-run hotel treat their guests like family. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms</span> too, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a bit small</span>, are clean and cozy. They also have <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a generous buffet breakfast served without charge</span>. They also offer a shuttle service for free from the airport but not to the airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location is pretty good too. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace are just a short walk away</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I'm not sure who is writing the reviews on this site but they are NOT accurate. The rooms are very basic and that's fine. BUT our carpet is ripped. The shower leaks and floods the bathroom every time you shower. There is tons of black mold in the shower and the bathroom smells musty. The bathroom is so small that you can't open the door fully without hitting the toilet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>My advice?</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Go to The Antioch Hotel across the street</span>. It's the same owners but it's much cleaner and the rooms and bathrooms are also a bit bigger. I don't think there is a big price difference, but whatever it is, it's worth it. Trust me.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a great little hotel. The management stop at nothing to make sure you are comfortable and happy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great breakfast</span> every morning and very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>central to</span> all the top <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>tourist sites</span> (hagia sofia, blue mosque, galata tower, archaeological museum, etc). The bathrooms can be a little small, depending on the room you are staying, but they are functional; lots of hot water. There's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>free wifi</span>, which we <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>never had any trouble using</span>, even up on the top floor. There's also an elevator which we had no issues with when used. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>is a little pricey, 45 Euros a night</span>, but the location and quality of the hotel are worth it.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here in May 2010 and were very disappointed. The only reason we didn't check out and go somewhere else was that everywhere else was booked out! Long story short they over booked the hotel and kept us waiting for 5 hours for our room! When we did eventually get in, the room stunk of cigarette smoke, was dirty, the toilet leaked and the staff were useless. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It completely ruined our Istanbul experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The good things about this hotel include</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the breakfast</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the location</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The first time I was in Istanbul, my husband - the third. I love the city and the hotel. Staff is very friendly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Room a bit cramped</span>, but for the 6 days of our stay was our own. At the end did not want to leave. Good price. And the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>breakfasts are good</span> too. Every day I gladly went to the cafe. If you want to relax in comfort, you can safely stay at this hotel!</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for 4 nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>For the price we paid i couldnt fault it</span>. the rooms were clean and comfortable and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the hotel was in a perfect location for all the tourist attractions</span>. the tram stop is 2 minutes away but we just walked everywhere. the hotel is down a side street but it is well lit and always busy so we felt safe even at night.</div><div class='text-box'>The service was perfect. We must left the room at 11:00 am, but we can use the rooms until 14:00 pm without extra paying. The personel was very nice and friendly. They help us very good. The rooms are very clean. The personels calling the services for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We're very saticified about hotel Hatay</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>it was a good hotel. with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>great value for money</span>, it was clean it was efficent and the hotel staff were very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it was in the best location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>all the main atractions</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>of istanbul</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>within walking distance</span>. and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>i recommed it to all</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'></span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The room was pretty cramped, and the bedding was a little tired (holes in it), and the internet intermittent.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was okay but was served across the street at the Antioch hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The best thing about the Hatay was the location which was convenient.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">We came back to Istanbul weeks later, at the end of our stay in Turkey and found much better accommodation, quieter, closer to the attractions for 20 euros less per night.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Shop around!</span></div></div>
