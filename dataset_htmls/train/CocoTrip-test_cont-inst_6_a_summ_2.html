<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Returned</span> yesterday <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>from a 2 night stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam</span> with my wife and 11 year old son <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and have to say what a joy it was,from the initial welcoming cup of tea to the final goodbye it was a superb experience</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel is very centrally located just a 10 minute walk from the Central Station</span> and next to a charming canal and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>although</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 6'>the rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>are on the small side(we</span> had the mini-suite in the loft which had a tricky low ceiling! and generally traditional Amsterdam hotels are on the small side) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>they</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>are beautifully decorated and very cosy with high quality furnishings</span>.Just <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>look out for the steep stairs</span> if you have large suitcases it can be hard work! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast was typically continental with cold meats,cereals and a lovely selection of bread ,fresh juice and good coffee</span> etc.served in a smart little dining room with a tv showing BBC news. What set this place apart for me was the service from all the staff who went out of their way to help and make us feel special-we have used many hotels in the US and Europe and can honestly say this hotel is right at the top when it comes to service,nothing was too much trouble. Would not hesitate in returning to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is located in Jordaan, beautiful district with very cozy restaurants. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The hotel has</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>modern looks,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>great breakfast</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> and the staff are nice and friendly</span>. I stayed in room 342, which is in the third floor, and has two twin beds. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was OK</span>, but I do have to say that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>each bed was extremely small! 68 cm wide (which is very small)</span> I actually asked the staff if this was normal, and they said that in Amsterdam hotels it is normal. Apart from this, I would recommend the hotel, but I would make sure, before making the reservation that they book you a room with normal sized beds. Oh, also, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the room rate doesn't include breakfast</span> (which was 7 euros, more or less)</div><div class='text-box'>I was in this hotel during 4 days, and it was perfect. Staff is really kind,they help us in any moment. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>for free</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>also tea and coffe</span>. Internet too for free. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel is only 5 minutes from central station</span>, and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>is placed in the best area of Amsterdam</span>, in the city center.Very nice room, so clean and beatifull with canal view. In my opinion, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel style is great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it is different</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 6'>prices are ok</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Hotels in Amsterdam is not cheap. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>hotel has a reasonable price</span> and has an excellent <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>location near the central station</span> but still <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in a very nice area</span>, Jordaan. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>The rooms</span> (we chose a L) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>are of a good size</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>reasonably clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The </span>"<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>continental breakfast" was toast and jam, with coffee or tea</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'></span> which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was kind of a let down</span>. But, at this price and location, it's a great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>The staff were friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was</span> comfortable but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>small</span>. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>believe they cater for a gay market</span>, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a small hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>located about a 5 minute walk from the Central Station in a quiet neighborhood in Amsterdam</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff is friendly and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>the rooms are simple and clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 6'>Most rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>tend to be a little small</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>are generally a pretty good value</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>They provide a breakfast which unfortunately is only bread/toast and jelly/jam</span> but there are plaves to eat nearby. They also offer free wireless internet.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at this just last week. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great place to stay,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>free breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and internet</span>. Just have to wait for everyone to log off so you can get on. Even books to read if you don't want to sightsee in a number of languages. Coffee and tea available all the time as well - free! Really close to everything as well.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 6'>very good value for money</span>. great location, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great service,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>great room</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>great breakfast</span> wish there was one of these hotels in every city</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A really nice hotel with ok prices and a unique style.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location is idyllic for those wanting to explore the area, as it is in close proximity to the city centre and station, with many of the main attractions only walking distance from the hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The room is nice but a little small.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">They are of a good value though and features nice high-quality furnishings.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">A great continental breakfast provided at this hotel, with a varied selection of foods.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Although not quite a buffet style breakfast that some may prefer, all food and drink comes free as part of the guest's stay here.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Not cheap, smallish rooms and steep stairs so take care.</span></div></div>
