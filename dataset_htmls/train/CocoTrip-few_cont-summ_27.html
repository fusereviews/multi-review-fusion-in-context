<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>After reading earlier reviews I was concerned that the facilities and expereince would not be as nice as I had hoped. From the description of the room we rented I thought it would be tight quarters. I was pleasantly surprised to find the atmosphere and facilities to be excellent. We stayed in a small suite, bedroom and a pull out couch. We had plenty of room and were very comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The pull out couch was of excellent quality and slept better than some beds I have expereinced</span> during travels. We stayed during the John Hagee ministeries event. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>The Chateau staff did an excellent job</span> handling the large crowd staying at the hotel and those that came in for the sessions. The Chateau made a nice Spring Break destination for these Michigan travelers.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed last weekend and was disappointed over some details. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Room 413 was very noisy.too</span> close to heating/AC units. Also room was right above delivery area which contributed to the noise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>Overall not a very welcoming feeling</span> at the Chateau. Coffee pot would not work and when I called to request another <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6 7'>the woman at the front desk was rude</span> and didn't seem to believe me. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6 7'>The doormen were unpleasant</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>and wouldn't even smile</span>, especially the one in the afternoon. I come to Branson often to visit family and for vacations and I'm sorry to say this will not be my choice of hotel in the future.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I stayed here before he deployed with the Army. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was so peaceful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The area is beautiful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>The staff went out of their way to make our stay something to remember</span>. Some of the small details of this resort really make a difference. The ice cream shop packed up banana spits for us to take to our room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The cafe restaurant had the best food</span>. We can't wait to go back. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Waking up to the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>chirping birds</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>trickle of the water</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>in</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 10'>the indoor atrium</span> made for a nice touch.</div><div class='text-box'>First time to Branson, stayed at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Chateau on the Lake</span>. It's about 10 minutes past the main strip of Branson activities but it's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>worth the drive for the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>gorgeous views</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>lovely relaxing hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>For the price</span> and service level of the hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I did expect to have a mini fridge</span> (empty or stocked) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>but our room</span> type (king lakeview) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>did not have one</span>. We took advantage of the great weather and hotel bar and had a glass of wine out on the deck. So lovely!</div><div class='text-box'>This was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>everything that i could of asked for</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5 7'>Nice people</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>nice scenery</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it was to die for</span>.
