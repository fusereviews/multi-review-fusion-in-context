<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel is situated at around 10 min by cab from the center</span> (barrio gotico). Must be max 10 years old. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Can be reached also by</span> tram or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>metro</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are clean</span>, beds a bit hard. Bar is OK and the patio too but mostly in the shadom in the evening. Rooms that had a sea view don't have it anymore (see previous reviews). A bit expensive for the location and the lack of view (my room had a view on a skeleton building (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all). The pool on the 17th is not heated, so quite difficult to swim at this time of the year, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nice view</span> on the utility building on the other side and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>on the sea and beach</span>, plus power plant for the rest.</div><div class='text-box'>The rooms and prices looked good and the pool looked attractive online, however the reality was different. I booked a family room which is really 2 separate bedrooms next to each other behind another door for privacy which was meant to lock but didn't. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>My kids room smelt like someone had smoked 100 cigarettes in it and had drugs and booze on the table when we checked in</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>They cleaned but the smell didn't go away</span> for all 3 days and they would not change the rooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The pool is tiny and over crowded</span> with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Well done for offering free WiFi</span> but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Overall it is good value</span> but it is most suited to weekend getaways for young party couples or mates.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the diagonal zero for 4 nights while attending a congress. The area near the hotel is not nice, however, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the metro station is nearby</span> and you can visit the centre in a few minutes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are spacious</span>, mattress is moderate, views are poor. The decoration is modern but on the poor side. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was ok</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>i consider it unacceptable to drink disgusting coffee from a machine</span> in a 4 star hotel.it shows lack of respect for the client. The Personnel was very polite. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>There is a very good gym in the hotel</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>free wifi</span> which is very important.</div><div class='text-box'>We only stayed one night but had most of 2 days sightseeing in Barcelona with fairly grown up family in 2 bedrooms. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Hotel happy to look after our luggage</span>. Perhaps <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>in an area a bit far from the character of Barcelona</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very convenient for</span> tram and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>subway</span>. Also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>large shopping centre close by with lots of dining choice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Pool a bit crowded</span> as our trip was in the heat of August and slightly disappointing that they charged for towel use. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Very helpful porter showed us control panel for lights/aircon etc - all very hi-tech</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Recently stayed here and was very impressed with this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Friendly staff</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>good clean rooms</span> and quiet so sleep no problem. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The beach is with 10 mins walking distance from the hotel</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>5 mins walk from a great shopping mall Diagonal Mar where there are lots of great restaurants</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The metro is a 2 min walk</span> and a 10 min journey or 6 stops to the centre of the city with no changes. We loved it!</div><div class='text-box'>I stay for 3 nights in a business trip, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the hotel is beautiful and the room was suburb</span>. Its <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>far from the city town</span> but have <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the beach nearby and a subway station pretty close</span>. For sure I will come back again</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for five nights at this hotel for a conference. By the end <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we couldn't wait to leave due to the monotonous breakfast</span>, below par cleanliness, and cold decor.</div><div class='text-box'>Wonderful hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>just a short metro ride away from Barcelona attractions</span>, with gorgeous rooftop pool. Excellent customer service.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Whilst it's ideally located for shopping and dining, and there is a beach and subway station nearby</span><span id="1" class="summary-sentence">, it's quite far from the true local character.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The room was spacious but was not as advertised online.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room was cleaned but there was a lingering smell and drug paraphernalia left there.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel staff were polite and accommodating.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Even one of the porters managed to show us how to work all of the mod cons of the room as well.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was okay enough but the coffee from a machine was quite unpleasant.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">There is free WiFi here at the hotel and a great gym .</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The pool looks a bit different than pictures provided online and was on the smaller side therefore crowded.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">Overall though it is worth the money charged.</span></div></div>
