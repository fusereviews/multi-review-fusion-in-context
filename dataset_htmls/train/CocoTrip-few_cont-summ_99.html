<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt - had a nice room (paid for an upgraded water view, which was nice to have), the staff was friendly and helpful, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location is perfect</span> and we had a very decent rate. The lobbies were pretty nice, but we didn't hang out there or eat at any of the places. We walked most places (or took a cab if our destination was really far), even in the middle of winter. I try not to be too picky about these things, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>our room was dusty the whole time we were there</span>. It was enough to be noticed, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>it should have been cleaned by the staff</span>. Also, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>we weren't very fond of the bed</span>. It was a bit on the hard side and wasn't exactly plus. It wasn't horrible though. Again, not horrible, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>our room was very hot no matter how we set the temp at</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Overall the hotel is ok</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very busy and noisy</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Valet parking is the only choice you have and an additional $50 for every 24 hours</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Valet parking stole our Ipod</span> so they told us to fill out a claims report which we did and then we had to wait more than a week to call the claims department because the one and only person they have working claims was on vacation. Once I was able to talk to the claims department she was no help at all. She basically called me a liar and we will not be getting reimbursed for the loss of our IPod. I am furious that it cost me $50 per day extra and then <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>we will have to pay another $250 + to replace our IPod</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here for two nights to partake in the Chicago St. Patricks festivities. Check in went super fast, and we were given a room the was so newly remodeled you could still catch a whiff of the fresh paint. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>It overlooked the river</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'> which made for some great shots</span> when they dyed it! Also, they allowed us a late check out of 2pm, at no charge, in order to not miss the parade. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The beds were amazing, as was the bathroom</span>. Plenty of space, with a very nice desk set up. And being one block from Michigan, and a 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this is a great location.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>I really don't think there is a better location in downtown</span>. So conveniently located off the river and a short jaunt to Michigan Ave, Grant Park, and Navy Pier. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I have already recommended this hotel to other travelers heading to Chicago</span>. I would say, however, the dining in the hotel is pretty pricey. So, if you are looking to save a few bucks get outside of the four walls of the hotel. That being said, I will still always stay at this hotel when traveling to Chicago, with out a doubt.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed two nights on business. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 3'>The location was great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and</span> the room was very nice. The price was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>$25-$30 cheaper than any comparable hotels</span> in the area. I had two minor complaints. The closet door was off the track, and wouldn't open when I checked in, and they didn't fix it the second day. Also, the Big Bar closed early, and the bartender was not very polite about letting me know before last call. Other than that, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would highly recommend the place</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>As a hotel, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it's very nice</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with very nice amenitiies</span>, but it's also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>expensive</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Canned soft drink in the mini-bar cost $4.25</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Internet use in the business center was something like $10 for 7 minutes</span> (or was that $7 for 10 minutes?). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Location is good</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>If price is no object, it's a good choice</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>but there are better bargains in the area.</span></div><div class='text-box'>The Hyatt is recently remodeled and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very nice</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was extremely friendly</span> and always helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>The location is centrally located on the mag mile</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we could easily walk to all there was to do downtown</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Will definitely stay here again</span>. Classy but not stuffy.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed there Feb 2005. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A former jewel that has fallen into disrepair</span>. The hotel is dark, and shabby. Even the newer wing is not up to par. If you stay in the Loop area, try the Burham instead.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is great and couldn't be better, therefore it is definitely recommended especially to other travellers heading to Chicago.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel is unbeatable because it is just off of the river.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There is an easy walk to experience downtown as well</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">so that's a great bonus to this well-located hotel.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were spacious but quite dusty and hot.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The beds were adequate and the bathrooms were amazing.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Some of the cleaning staff did miss an area that should have been cleaned.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Unbelievably it was quite expensive just for a canned soft-drink from the minibar in this hotel room.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The only available parking at the hotel is valet which can be costly.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The use of internet is costly too.</span></div></div>
