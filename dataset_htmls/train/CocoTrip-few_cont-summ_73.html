<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great Hotel The River in Florence is a real find and probably was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>one of the best hotels that we stayed at on our trip</span>. It is located across the street from the Arno in the San Croce area. Our daughter and I liked the location because this area of Florence was very clean and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>away from the main hubbub of the city</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>There is a bus stop very close to the hotel</span>. We arrived by train and took the number 13 to the hotel and the number 12 took us back to the train station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The staff is very accommodating</span> and the reception area and breakfast area were very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The hotel also offerred free internet access</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Fabulous service, great location <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel</span> River. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>The cheerful, personal touch and helpfulness of the staff</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>(particularly Salvatore the concierge who gave great tips re restaurants)</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>made our stay an absolute pleasure</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5 7'>The view of the river Arno</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5'>from our terrace was beautiful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location was</span> just right - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>a short walk from the centre</span> but far enough away from the attractions so as to be quiet.The room was quite small but comfortable and clean and had a nice bathroom and a great shower.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>There was free internet access in the hotel lobby</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would highly recommend the Hotel</span> River and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Florence.</div><div class='text-box'>Nice and quiet <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Incredible little hotel</span> away from the noise of Florence, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>walking distance of only 10 minutes to city center</span>. Great sized rooms and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>beautifully decorated</span>. Very clean with decently sized bathrooms for Europe. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Beds were very hard</span>. Breakfast served beautifully and elegantly with many choices, based on basic Italian breakfast of pastries, cold cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs (with cute little cups and spoons), fruit and real coffee! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Very small staff works hard to meet every need</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>Great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>place to have a drink before dinner in the lobby</span> or on <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the rooftop balcony with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 7'>view of the Arno</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 5'>Lovely hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5'>with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 5 7'>pretty view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>of the river</span> We stayed in this central hotel after changing from a dismal, allegedly three-star hotel. The room was pretty and clean, with a nice view of inner courtyard. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Staff were friendly and very helpful</span>, and we were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>close to all the main sights</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 7'>hotel balcony was lovely</span> to sit around and watch the world go by and see the river below. I would recommend this as a good value, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>better than 3-star hotel</span> and would visit again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Small but</span> perfectly formed A <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>charming</span> clean and comfortable <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Polite and helpful staff</span>.A short walk (or <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>inexpensive bus ride) to the historic attractions</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The knowledgeable manager will tell you which buses go where as well as sell you the tickets</span>. He also directed us to the shop selling the gorgeous room fragrance that was in our room.Standard breakfast in an enclosed terrace or in the elegant lower breakfast room.
