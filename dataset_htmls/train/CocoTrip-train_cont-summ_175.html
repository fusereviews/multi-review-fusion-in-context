<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>If you want to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>near the airport</span>, I recommend this hotel! Nice location within a few miles of MCO. We stayed here overnight for an early flight out in the morning. The hotel is new and in great condition. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The suites are nice with a small seating area and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>nice comfortable bedroom</span>. I really liked the lights directly over the headboard; they were controlled by a switch close by-great for reading! Small sink but nice shelves around it. We had a view of a small lake and the outdoor pool from our window. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast was good</span> with a few hot items along with the usual fare. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I hope to stay here again when we fly in and out of Orlando</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This turned out to be a great place to stay for three nights. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is conveniently located, and although is very close to the airport,</span> there isn't much noise. The rooms were a little small, but adequate for two people. We especially liked the configuration of the suite with the separate desk/living room area. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Staff was very friendly</span> and helpful. My husband enjoyed the lounge/business area in the lobby too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast was just ok</span>, but there are restaurants all around if you're looking for more of a gourmet experience. It was cozy-particularly for an "airport" hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I would definitely stay here again</span>, especially with the convenient access to the 528 Expressway.</div><div class='text-box'>This is a wonderful hotel. We stayed here one night before going on a cruise. The staff gets an A+. Everyone was really nice and went out of their way to make us comfortable. We did have a run in with one of the shuttle drivers but I will not lower the hotelas score because of one person especially since the other drivers were great. It is in a good location and we were able to walk to certain places. The hotel lobby was clean and quiet. The rooms are huge and clean. We had a great time the short time we were at the hotel. Oh I forgot to mention that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the breakfast buffet was the best</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here for 3 nights for a business trip and had a comfortable stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms are nicely arranged for a living/working area with a sofa, couch, desk, microwave, and refrigerator. And the other part of the room is the bed and bathroom</span>. There isn't a lot of counter space, but still very nice. Complimentary breakfast is served and the spread is the typical continental breakfast - bread, muffins, waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It's very close to the airport and the Hertz rental car returns</span>. You can walk to nearby restaurants too.</div><div class='text-box'>This newly built (2007) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>airport hotel</span> has all the amenities you need, and is very clean. The standard <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4'>suites</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>perfect with separate bathroom sinks from the shower and toilet</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>they have a good-sized seating/living area for the price</span>. Nice kitchen and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>all very clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>comfortable</span>. It also has a nice pool area with some chaise lounge chairs and a decent sized fitness center. The buffet <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast was good enough</span>, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>service</span> all around (restaurant, house-keeping and reception) was excellent and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>friendly</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My husband I stayed at the Springhill Suites for pre and post cruise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is very close to MCO</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We rented a car from Budget and the hotel offered free parking</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Room was</span> clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfast in the morning was good</span>. The hotel has a business centre with 2 computers and free Internet access. In the mornings, the sound of planes overhead can be heard but we were up early so it didn't disturb us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.</span></div><div class='text-box'>Our family stayed here for one night after a Disney Trip over Thanksgiving weekend. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was conveiently located near the airport. We dropped off our rental car and called the hotel and the shuttle came to pick us up.</span> It is within walking distance to a few restaurants and they gave us coupons for these as well. The hotel is very well-maintained and clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Free breakfast in the morning was nice</span> as was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the complimentary shuttle service to the airport</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Would definitely stay here again.</span></div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for a night before a cruise after coming in late. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>It</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is very convenient located to the airport and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>has an Airport Shuttle</span>, which we didn't use. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>The rooms were comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and the breakfast was very good</span>, with a great selection. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff was very friendly,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>overall a great value</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 6'>for the money</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">It is located very close to the airport and very convenient for a rental car return at the airport.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">There is also an airport shuttle.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was good for this price range.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff was friendly and this place is a good value for the money.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The suites are nice with a bedroom, a sitting area with wet bar, and a bath area.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The bathroom and shower were nice and clean!</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">I would stay here again if in the area.</span></div></div>
