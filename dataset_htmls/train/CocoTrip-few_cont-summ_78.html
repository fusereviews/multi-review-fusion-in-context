<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Cheapest decent hotel in Chicago that I could find. Nice large room which was pretty modern looking considering the age of the building. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Appreciated the free WiFi</span> and the fact that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>you have to swipe your key to get on the elevator or stairs- extra security</span> (though somehow the pizza delivery guy was able to get up to our room, must have an agreement with the hotel.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Street noise didn't bother me too much</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was great</span>, although the room was a little cramped. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='10'>The only complaint I have is that its hard to pull up to the front of the hotel to get valet parking</span> ($22/24 hours) Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here by myself the night before a group tour and got a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>single room, which came with a double bed</span>. The sheets are soft and there four pillows on the bed! Awesome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room is perfect for one or two people</span>. The area is great, although not serviceable by the train, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it has buses to the city</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The area itself is really upbeat, with a young crowd</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Great little shops</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> restaurants and bars</span>. I'd stay here again for sure if I were in Chicago. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It's a nice alternative to the large downtown hotels</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my first trip to Chicago and Days Inn made it even better! It is a great bargain especially for the location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The hotel was clean</span>, the staff was so darn nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the free bfast was mmm soo good-</span> the muffins were amazing, fresh squeezed juice, and even make your own waffles. The only complaint is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the drain in the shower wasn't working as smoothly as it should have been</span>. I can't see how anything could go wrong here and even if it did, front desk was just so ncie!</div><div class='text-box'>The staff at this hotel were extremely gracious and went out of their way to welcome me. I arrived early and the staff <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>had a room cleaned and ready</span> for me promptly. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Property is located right in the heart of Lincoln Park and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>there are numerous dining and nightlife options</span> at the property doorstep. I will definitely return to this property. The Days Inn brand gets a serious upgrade in my mind with properties of this character.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Travelled with a friend</span> for a quick getaway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>We were in a room with 2 beds</span>, fridge, & micro(we were in room 403), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>room with views of Clark St.</span> As always it was a great stay, staff very friendly, and willing to help in any way possible. If your not a continental b-fast kind-of-person, I would suggest The Golden Nugget one block south of Diversey on Clark.</div><div class='text-box'>This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>old Days Inn is in the heart of Lincoln Park</span> and a short walk to Boys Town.The hotel was clean and the free <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>breakfeast was a</span> big <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>hit</span>. My only complait are the bathrooms. Time to upgrade! They all have this 3 inch step up which is just great to trip over at 3 am in the dark. Other then that this is a nice hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 15 years. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>It is</span> quiet, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>clean</span>, moderately priced, and very conveniently <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>located near</span> several <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>bus lines</span>. Clark Street, on which it is located, is a major shopping street, and there is parking at the nearby Century Mall. I have found the staff to be friendly and helpful.</div><div class='text-box'>We booked this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel for a girl's trip</span> to Chicago. I booked solely on written reviews.and boy were we impressed! For the price, this hotel is PERFECT! The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>beds were great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>rooms were very clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>breakfast was the best.waffles.YUMMY.and</span> the staff was so helpful and friendly! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location to public transportation</span>. Highly recommend this property!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideal for a boisterous and young crowd, such as a girl's trip.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is close to bus routes into the city and is a good change of place to stay from the downtown alternatives.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located in the centre of Lincoln Park with restaurants and a good night life.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel itself is located on Clark Street which is a shoppers' delight.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has double beds in the single rooms which is great for one or two people.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very clean although the drain in the shower needs some attention.</span><span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provided a good breakfast to guests.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has good security, as your key card is needed to gain access to elevators or stairwells.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There is free WiFi provided too.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">There was some street noise but not loud enough to cause concern.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">It is worth mentioning that it is difficult to park for the valet out front of the hotel.</span></div></div>
