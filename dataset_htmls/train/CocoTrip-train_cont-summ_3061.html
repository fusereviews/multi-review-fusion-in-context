<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We booked this hotel over the internet then read the reviews! My husband and i were very worried about this 1st stay in london because of all the bad reviews this hotel had got! We need not have worried on arrival we were checked in by the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>very helpful</span> and polite <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>receptionist</span>,he informed us of all the details we needed to know, breakfast ect.Yes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bedrooms are a little small</span> but very clean and warm, i also agree with others about <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bathroom/shower very small</span> but fine for the amount of time you would have to spend in it, We enjoyed the full english which was once again served by very polite and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>friendly staff</span>, dining area was quite big, we really enjoyed our stay (2 nights) at this hotel and would def return.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This hotel was very much in need of refurbishment</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>Carpets throughout were threadbare</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>and the place did not seem clean</span>. Our room was on the 3rd floor and as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>there was no lift</span> it was a challenge.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was tiny</span> and we had a back of hotel room,which did not even have a view.The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>window was opaque and broken</span>.When we managed to get it open the outside was disgusting and covered in pigeon droppings. The bathroom was like a cupboard and very claustrophobic.My partner is not very mobile and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>could not use the shower as he could not turn round in it</span>! The curtain wraps itself round you and is in the way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The staff were offhand and not very welcoming</span>,breakfast was ok but basic. We shold have read the reviews first!</div><div class='text-box'>We found the hotel room clean but with dated mismatched furniture. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bathroom was tiny, barely room to stand under the shower</span>, and smelt unpleasant. Coming down to breakfast on the first morning we entered the dining room only to be told to wait outside as there was no room, we waited outside for about ten minutes before finally being allowed in. Breakfast was ok except on the last day when they ran out of bacon and we were given cold watery waferthin ham instead. The carpets in the hallways were filthy - the only pleasant thing about our stay were the reception <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>staff</span> who although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>ineffectual were very friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel was advertised as a 3 star I can't believe it meets this standard</span>. Would not book here again.</div><div class='text-box'>I always use the Royal Norfolk Hotel on brief stays to London. It is close to the arrival station Paddington am,always <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>greeted by freindly staff</span>. The only negative point is that in three seperate stays over three years <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the lift has been out of order</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The twin room</span> that my friend and I stayed in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was very small with a caravan like bathroom</span>. However for the online rate of A64 was superb as we only wanted the room as a base and to have a good nights rest which we had without any problem. The room was warm the beds comfortable. We did not have breakfast as we woke up to late. I shall definitely return.</div><div class='text-box'>We arrived at the hotel on 25th October for a 2 night break. After reading the reviews we were slightly worried, however when we arrived the first thing i thought was great location. When we checked in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the staff were pleasant</span>. Our room was on the first floor, so we were lucky as the stairs were rather high. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was small but clean and good enough</span> for what we needed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bathroom was very small but</span> again, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it was good enough.</span> Breakfast was nice except for the garlic mushrooms, little odd to me. Overall, i would say the Royal Norfolk is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nice little hotel and very good value for money</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>We booked this hotel for one night and requested 2 rooms on the same floor as we had 2 children, 2 months before we arrived. The rooms were 3 floors apart, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>no help or assistance given when we arrived</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The carpets are threadbare</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and dirty, the curtains the same. The en-suite was mouldy, small, dirty</span> and no hot water. During the night our door was banged upon with people trying to get in. We ended up having all 4 of us in one room, sleeping on towels and leaving at 6am just to get out of there. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>DO NOT STAY HERE, awful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Although we've been to London many times, we never had a hotel with toilets as dirty as the Royal Norfolk hotel. Our room was nice and clean, shower was ok. But when we checked out i had to go to the toilet one last time. I was sent to the toilets at the Hotel lobby. Check for yourself how they looked when i got there! We were also told there was a full English breakfast served, but when we asked for it they made us pay for it. We were told, the English breakfast wasn't included with the room we had!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in this hotel from 2 december till 7 december, and we think itAs a fair acommodation for the price we payed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room and the bathroom are very small, but nothingAs missing</span>! The bed is confortable and the room ir warm for the temperatures we felt in London. The hotel is near almost everything, and the London tube is across the road. The breakfast is ok too. If you want something more luxurious, the Hilton is across the street, but you wonAt pay 65A a day!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">How can this be a 3* hotel?</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The whole place needs refurbishing.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The carpets are threadbare, the single rooms we had were exceptionally small and the shower/toilet room too small for comfort.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The lift did not work.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The bed linen and towels were clean and the staff friendly and helpful.</span></div></div>
