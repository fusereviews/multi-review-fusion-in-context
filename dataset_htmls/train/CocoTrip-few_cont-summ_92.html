<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I took a quick 3 day weekend trip to Toronto (my first trip there) with friends to see a ballgame and the Hockey Hall of Fame and take a quick tour of the city. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff at the Grand was very</span> friendly, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>helpful</span> and attentive. Feeling welcome is very unusual in todays mega-chain hotels, but the Grand was top notch in that respect. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Excellent free breakfast buffet</span>, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Underground parking is expensive, $19.00 per night, but I was not charged</span>. The neighborhood is very colorful, but if you want a sanitized version of a city, stay on the Las Vegas strip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>You will feel safe anywhere you walk in Toronto</span>, and Toronto is a city that should be walked to be experienced.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>We were satisfied with our stay at this hotel</span>. The service was very good, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the hotel was clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the breakfast was decent</span>, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>rooms were just fine</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe</span>, nonetheless. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>A bit outside of the city center</span>, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district</span>. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff were attentive and very gracious</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would definitely stay here again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a great deal online for a nice room with a beautiful view - the small suite with a foldout couch was perfect for our family of four. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5 6'>staff was pleasant</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'> knowledgeable and helpful</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> with lots of tips for getting around</span>. The location is not excellent - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it's on the outskirts of downtown</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the neighborhood is a bit scary</span> even for those of us from other large cities - but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the hotel provides a free shuttle</span>, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 8'>All in all, a nice stay</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we'd go back</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have just returned home from my Canadian Getaway. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 8'>The hotel is fantastic</span> and we have never experienced such incredible service before. Our room always looked spectacular, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>front desk staff was always extremely helpful</span>. We ate a couple meals at the hotel which were both great. I would recommend this restaurant and hotel to anyone travelling into Toronto or that even live in Toronto! I've visited Toronto many times and love the city, yet i've never wanted to stay in the hotel so much before. The roof top was beautiful at night or in the day. If you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to Toronto then <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this Hotel is an absolute must</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the Grand hotel</span> for 2 nights, and it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>was great</span>. Our Junior Suites were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>The staff was very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>friendly, helpful, and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>accomodating</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The location was excellent - steps away from the Eaton Centre and</span> great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>shopping</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>We had a lovely complementary breakfast each morning including both hot and cold food</span>. Complementary internet access was very useful in keeping in touch with family. We pretty much had the beautiful pool, whirpool, and locker room facilities to ourselves - also very clean. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>will definitely be staying at the Grand hotel again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The only complaint I have with this hotel is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>the buffet breakfast</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'> which</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7 8'>was included in the price of the room</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'> was lousy</span>. Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great hotel with terrific service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street</span>. A good diner/grill/bar across the road. Despite the breakfasts, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I'd stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Liked the hotel, the rooms</span>, the pool, the hot tub on the roof. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Location close to everything you need</span>, but somehow the blocks <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>surrounding the Grand Hotel are not the nicest area</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I didn't feel safe there</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 5 6'>Staff was very helpfull</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>with directions around the city</span>. Location was fine , <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>We had no problems with anyone</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>in the area</span> despite what other people have said in their reviews.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The Grand Hotel is great and staying again is certainly worth considering.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Easy trips to Toronto and overall satisfaction of the hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is perfectly located for those touring Toronto.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Close to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street, as well as the general shopping areas of town.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">A generally safe area and a free shuttle is provided for travel to other tourist areas. too.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the local area too.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Very accommodating.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel provides a buffet breakfast, both hot and cold.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The quality is adequate for the price .</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has underground parking, which can be expensive if charged.</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has a scenic rooftop area with lots of seating available.</span> </div></div>
