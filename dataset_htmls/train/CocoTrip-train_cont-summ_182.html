<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor</span> and agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great location</span>, especially if you have a short stay in S. Francisco and want to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>handy for all the attractions</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>just across the Square from Macy's</span>. We stayed on the fifth floor at the back and as the hotel is older in style the solid walls meant that it was very quiet and we heard no noise at all. Perhaps <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the bathroom could be a bit</span> bigger and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>more modern</span> but it was clean and functional. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We liked the free jar of sweets in our room</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Also the free coffee/tea at the reception area and the super cookies</span> baked fresh every day. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Found the staff helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>We would stay here again</span> if we were returning to S.F. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>Good value</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Just back from a trip to San Fran and Las Vegas. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Our stay</span> at The Chancellor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was wonderful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is superb</span> and the room was lovely. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bed was exceptionally comfy</span> and the room was a good size, perhaps in US terms it would be classified as small, but in European terms it was good. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful</span> and it was so easy to get access to the hotel computer to print out my boarding pass. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The free tea/ coffee in the lobby was great</span> as after a full day walking about the city, it was fab to have a refreshing cuppa and a biscuit. The ice water with cucumber was also a lovelt touch and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I would highly recommend this hotel</span> to anyone visiting the city.</div><div class='text-box'>We had booked this hotel for 3 days and ended up staying 7. It was very clean with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>great staff</span> and the room was a great size for the 2 of us. Loved soaking in the big tub. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location was great</span> - very central. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is right on the cable car line</span> and also within walking distance of a great many attractions. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The coffee and cookies in the lobby are a great touch</span>.
