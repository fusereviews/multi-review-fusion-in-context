<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Raffaello for three nights. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel is</span> in a safe area and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>within walking distance to</span> the Colosseum and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Termini</span>. The rooms were very clean but the shower was incredibly small. If you are over 6 foot you probably won't fit. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Personnel</span> at the desk <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were</span> very friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span> with all our questions, directions, and requests for taxi service. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our 12 day travels throughout Italy, and included scrambled eggs daily. One day, however, a lady had her purse stolen while at the breakfast buffet. Someone must have come in from the outside, blended in with the crowd, and made off with the purse. If I return to Italy I would try to stay nearer the Campo de Fiori area for the night life and restaurants.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed five nights in the Hotel Raffaello in June. It was an absolute pleasure from the time we were checked in by Angelo until our departure. We had been conned by a taxi driver out of 90 for a 10 fare and of course were upset upon arrival. But Angelo was fabulous and we stayed in the room with the balcony, which was a great size. We were there to get engaged and as I had mentioned that to Angelo, within ten minutes of getting into our room a bottle of champagne was delivered up to us. The staff are absolutely lovely and I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know travelling to Rome. We hated to leave. To all of the staff in Hotel Raffaello, thank you for your kindness.</div><div class='text-box'>We found the Raffaello hotel to meet all our needs. The room was very comfortable and even enjoyed the jacuzzi shower once we worked out how to use it! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location is excellent, 5 mins away from the Termini</span> and the Colosseum and an easy walk to all other tourist locations. Especially enjoyed the breakfast which offered an assortment of pastries, cold meats, bread, scrambled eggs, fruit and cake. Yum Yum! Amazing cappuccino's!</div><div class='text-box'>Because of a mistake on my part, I had to cancel the day of our arrival at the last minute. After explaining my problem they took car of the change without charges. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We cannot rave enough about the service from the front desk staff and the wonderful treatment by the two women in the breakfast room</span>. The rooms were roomy and beyond clean. We think this is a hidden gem in Rome. Joe & Bev Wood Macungie PA</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent location if you want to consider somewhere close enough to the main train terminus to walk to/back, and near the main tube line as well as the historic sites. The room was very pleasant no noise, and breakfast was simple but substantive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel</span> is also near to the large supermarket which may be used to make lunch to help reduce costs on the long days walks ahead. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great centre overall to base your visit</span></div><div class='text-box'>Clean, comfortable room with good wi-fi connection. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Staff was very</span> friendly and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>helpful</span>. As mentioned by other reviewers, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>close to the train station</span> and colosseum, a bit distant to Campo de' Fiore, Piazza Navona, etc. Other comparable hotels were more expensive, so this was a very good value. Solid 3 star type of hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>A wonderful <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>accessible to all historic attractions</span> friendly family with very good SERVICE warm atmosphere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff were very helpful</span>. Felt like home</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Friendly</span>. Good deal.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideally located and good for local public transportation.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very helpful too.</span></div></div>
