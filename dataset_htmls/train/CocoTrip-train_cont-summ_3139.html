<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>From checkin to checkout <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 9'>this hotel exceeded our expectations</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The location was perfest</span>, the room was perfect, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the breakfast was perfect</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the staff were good</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The rate included breakfast</span> and the breakfast had it all: eggs, both scrambled and hard boiled, bacon, fruit, cereal, good coffee etc. The underground train was 100 meters from the door and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>you can go anywhere in Berlin</span> with it. The Hard Rock was across the street and there were resaurants everywhere. We aren't great shoppers but there were stores everywhere to take your money. We took a hop on hop off tour and found it worthwhile. The checkpoint charlie museum highlited the desperation of that era. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>For the price we paid</span> 55 euro a nite <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>it was a special 4 star hotel</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The location is really good</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>close to a main train station</span>, close to lots of restaurants and coffee shops. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The room was very disappointing, and not four stars</span>. Everything was clean, the bed firm (but creaky), shower ok. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>But the deco was very dated</span> (70s style with worn carpet), the blind ripped (no curtains), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>very poor lighting</span> (don't think about doing your make up in the bathroom) and the room layout was very poor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Given the images on the website and price I was expecting a lot better</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>If you get a good deal, and are not going to spend much time in the room, then this hotel is ok</span>. But I wouldn't stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>With <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>great location</span> (just a few minutes walk from Zoological garten station) this hotel provides good value for money if booked with discount from one of the internet sights. We got a room on the 5th floor facing the garden so it was very quiet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room</span> was very big with a big bathroom. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was really clean but the interiour was dated</span> and quite worn-out. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfeast buffe was great</span> with good selection of food <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>but it is not worth 17 euros</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>I would recommend this hotel but</span> one should bare in mind that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 9'>it is old and not a fancy 4-star that you would expect from the pictures</span> on their website.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>Hotel Zoo is in a fantastic location</span>, easy to get to via bus from Tegal airport, close to shops, etc, etc. The Hotel is not 4 stars. It is in need of renovation, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the rooms</span> are tired, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>can be noisy</span> (and no air conditioning which was an issue during our summer stay). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The hotel is however clean and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 7'>the staff are very helpful</span>, and for the price the location is the best. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>I found the beds very worn</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and had trouble sleeping</span>, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 9'>would probably spend more money next time for a newer hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>to get decent sleep</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the Hotel Zoo for a long weekend. We booked through a BA holiday deal and as a result the room we were allocated was probably not the best they could offer. The bedroom and bathroom were small and the corridors bizarrely lit with fluorescent pink lighting! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Our room was on the first floor adjacent to the dining room, so</span> during the breakfast period (from 7 - 11 on weekends) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>we were constantly disturbed</span> by clattering plates and cutlery etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The location of the hotel was good</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>right next to the Ku'damm metro station</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 9'>I wouldn't stay here again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 9'>The hotel is in a good location</span> on the main shopping street and very near to the zoo and u-bahn, s-bahn station. The area was busy and felt safe at night. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel entrance was a lot nicer than</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the rooms</span> but the one we had was large and although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>wasn't very modern</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>I wouldn't call it 4 star</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 9'>it was fine considering the price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast was good</span> too, lots too choose from.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>The hotel has an excellent location</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the staff are friendly</span> and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfasts are very good</span> with lots of choice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 3'>rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 3'>corridors</span>, however, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 3'>are shabby</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>years overdue for refurbishment</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2 9'>It is definitely not 4* standard</span>, if the hotel is not careful it could get done if it continues to claim 4* status.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>We</span> stayed at Hotel Zoo for three days/nights and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were very satisfied</span> with the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location</span> at Kurfurstendamm <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is very good</span>, the staff is friendly and the rate was very reasonable and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>included a great breakfast</span>. We will not hesitate to book a stay at Hotel Zoo the next time we visit Berlin.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">First of all the location is great and the entrance of the hotel/reception is very modern and when we arrived we were sure we made the right choice.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">But then we were dissapointed.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Nothing reminded us of a four star hotel.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The carpet of the corridors is really dirty and the rooms have very old furniture.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The windows are very old and the rooms are very noisy because of the train station and the car traffic of the road.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast is average and does not worth 15 euros!</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">You can get great breakfast outside the hotel with 5-7 euros.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The staff is friendly but that's about it.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">But Berlin was fantastic and the location is ideal</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">so I would recommend it to friends.</span></div></div>
