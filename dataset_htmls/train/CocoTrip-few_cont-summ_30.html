<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Hotel Victoria</span> is great as a base from which to see the city. It's on Yonge Street, bonus, and is reasonably priced. Things like CN Tower, Rogers Centre/Skydome, the Eaton Centre, harbourfront, Hockey Hall of Fame, Union station and Dundas Square are all between 5 and 20 minutes' walk. A <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>list of good food options in the area would have the 'Richtree market restaurant</span>' at the top (it's also one of the closest), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>nice 'takesushi' place around the corner</span>, Baton Rouge closer to Dundas square. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. You don't choose hotel victoria because you want luxury, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>nice thick walls that block out most noise</span>, or a view of anything but a brick wall (in our room anyway), but like i said it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>has friendly staff</span>, is reasonably priced and is in a great location.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a decent deal online by having to show our concert ticket to Bon Iver at Massey Hall. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The queen room</span> was small but nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>recently updated</span>, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>hotel</span> was in a great location about a ten minute walk to Queen street and only a few minutes from the GO station / Union. We paid a little extra for the "Business Room" which came with a bottle of water - although there was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>no fridge</span>, a paper in the morning and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Apple TV, which was a good to have</span> after the show. The only faults: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>we were a disappointed when we asked downstairs for wine glasses</span> on our way in, as we brought a bottle for after the show; and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the pillows were a bit</span> high/<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>full</span> for us - pretty minor. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The breakfast down in the adjoining restaurant, Over Easy was great</span> in the morning.</div><div class='text-box'>stayed here for three nights. they are renovations going on at the moment in the lobby but don't let that put you off - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we were on 2nd floor - newly renovated and didn't hear a thing</span>. rooms are contemporary (new new blue woodedn floor) - clean rooms but be careful as bath in slippery - they have a bath mat for you to use. would have been nice if there were a few leaflets on site seeing in toronto - there was only a niagara leaflet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Must eat in Over Easy - restaurant just walk through hotel lobby - they do breakfast</span>/lunch from 10am-4pm. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the french toast and side of fresh fruit is magic</span>. would recommend this hotel - hockey hall of fame is 5 minute walk - CN tower 15 mins and downtown shopping in yonge is a ten minute walk.</div><div class='text-box'>My girlfriend and I are staying here late November on an extended business trip. (for the first time) Before we have even stayed there, I can say I am <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>more than satisfied with the service at this Hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I sent an email to the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Sales Manager</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>with a couple of questions</span> about the hotel and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>he</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>got back to me with polite answers\suggestions in a timely manner</span>. This is officially the first time I have ever written a review before I have stayed somewhere. Looking forward to our experience there.</div><div class='text-box'>Best hotel stay I've ever had! Every year my boyfriend and I celebrate our anniversary by having a hotel night, our normal hotel was unavaliable so we looked around and immediatly fell in love with the modern decor of these <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms</span>. The location was amazing, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>having Netflicks avaliable to us as well was wonderful</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the hotel staff were very very nice</span>! I think my boyfriend and I have found a new hotel for our future anniversaries! To sum up my experience: it was amazing!</div><div class='text-box'>Location is perfect, just on Yonge and Wellington (close to Eaton centre for shopping and CN Tower Skydome for sightseeing). Althouigh, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the breakfast</span> was an extra cost (there is an over easy in the hotel), this <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>was quite good</span> value for money <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>and a good way to start the day</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The free wi-fi in the rooms was a God send</span>. Room was nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the shower was really good</span>. I would definitely recommend people to stay here.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed over thr weekend and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>VERY impressed with the quality of service(friendly staff)</span> and the great room (really clean). I heard that they will be renovating in the near future and will make another reservation to see what the results are. Highly recommended</div><div class='text-box'>Convenient location downtown. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff were courteous and helpful</span>. The room was modern and suited our needs for a one night rental.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The room featured WiFi and Apple TV, which was a great touch.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Additionally the shower was excellent.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The only negatives really are the pillows were pretty full and there was no refrigerator in the room.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were polite and accommodating.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The sales manager that was contacted was efficient in response and helpful with suggestions.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There are great food options around the hotel but the breakfast in the connected restaurant was really great.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The second floor of the hotel was recently refurbished and quiet.</span></div></div>
