<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great Hotel The River in Florence is a real find and probably was one <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>of the best hotels</span> that we stayed at on our trip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It is located across the street from the Arno</span> in the San Croce area. Our daughter and I liked the location because this area of Florence was very clean and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>away from the main hubbub of the city</span>. There is a bus stop very close to the hotel. We arrived by train and took the number 13 to the hotel and the number 12 took us back to the train station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The staff is very accommodating</span> and the reception area and breakfast area were very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The hotel also offerred free internet access</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Fabulous service, great location We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel River. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>cheerful,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>personal touch and helpfulness of the staff</span> (particularly Salvatore the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>concierge</span> who <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>gave great tips re restaurants</span>) made our stay an absolute pleasure. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>The view of the river Arno from our terrace</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>was beautiful</span> and the location was just right - a short walk from the centre but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>far enough away from the attractions so as to be quiet</span>.The room was quite small but comfortable and clean and had a nice bathroom and a great shower.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>There was free internet access in the hotel lobby</span>.We would highly recommend the Hotel River and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Florence.</div><div class='text-box'>Nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>quiet</span> Incredible little <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel</span> away from the noise of Florence, but walking distance of only 10 minutes to city center. Great sized <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beautifully decorated</span>. Very clean with decently sized bathrooms for Europe. Beds were very hard. Breakfast served beautifully and elegantly with many choices, based on basic Italian breakfast of pastries, cold cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs (with cute little cups and spoons), fruit and real coffee! Very small <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>staff works hard to meet every need</span>. Great place to have a drink before dinner in the lobby or on the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>rooftop</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 7'>balcony with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3 7'>view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>of the Arno</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Lovely hotel</span> with pretty view of the river We stayed in this central hotel after changing from a dismal, allegedly three-star hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was pretty</span> and clean, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>with a nice view</span> of inner courtyard. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Staff were friendly and very helpful</span>, and we were close to all the main sights. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>hotel balcony was lovely</span> to sit around and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>watch the world go by</span> and see the river below.
