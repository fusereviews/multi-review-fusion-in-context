The restaurant in the hotel serves good meals. Value for money.</div><div class='text-box'>The Erboy hotel is definitely one that i can recommend to fellow travelliers. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The Erboy allows short walks to most interesting places of Istanbul ( Hagia Sophia, Topkapi palace</span>, Great Bazar, Egyptian Bazar, Cisterns. etc.) and to the railway station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms and bathrooms were clean and nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We always had fresh sheets and towels</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The service was excellent from the reception and from the rest of the staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast was lovely and breakfast area was nice</span>.
