<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Would come back again and again We have been staying at Island Shangri-la once every year for the past 7 years. They have continued to improve their service year after year. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The service is impeccable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms</span> were renovated a couple of years ago and they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>added a modern twist</span>. But <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the level of comfort and 'homeyness' has been retained</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>With the Pacific Place mall right underneath the hotel</span>, it is so convenient to just go down and shop, knowing that even if you carry a lot of bulky items. There is no worry about riding through the mrt or lining up to get a taxi. You can just catch the elevator and go right up to your room. It is always a perfect experience staying at the hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>Good, but not unforgettable This hotel is certainly good enough as a business hotel. However, I really will not stay here for a leisure trip. As mentioned in another review, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>there are just no personal touches</span> or charm. The staff is polite but the service is more mechanical, rather than from the heart. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>There is a pool</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>but</span> it offers a view of skyscrapers nearby. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It's really quite hard to relax in this evironment</span>.The location is not bad as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it is connected to the subway via a big shopping mall</span>. However, in the morning, a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>cab ride can take quite long to reach the central business district due to traffic jam</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>OK, not spectacular. I spent a few nights at the Shangri La in August. I found the overall experience lacking.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are bland, all function with surprisingly little style</span> (surprising given the strong feng shui influence in HK). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are also small</span>, even by HK/Toyko standards. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Lunch at the cafe was expensive and disappointing</span>. Breakfast was much better, though also very expensive.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The pool is really nice, and the gym is good</span>. The staff was OK, but interactions felt rushed and reminded me more of a NYC business hotel than a true 5 star.Don't be afraid to try somewhere else.</div><div class='text-box'>once again, great stay once again, a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>great stay</span>, upgraded to a harbour view as it was our silver wedding aniversary, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>flowers, fruit etc as well</span>, i love this hotel so much, such humble and smilley staff considering it is regullaly voted one of the best hotels in the world for everything, fab possition, great rooms, wonderfull staff, do i own it or work for them? no,we just love staying here, well done, shangri- la once again!</div><div class='text-box'>consistently excellent I stay at the island SRL frequently with business, and it isconsistently excellent - staff are always amazing. Isupposethe only picky downside is if <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>you like modern it may be a littlechinzy</span> for you!The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>service is outstanding.the bar lady in the foyer bar has remembered the drink I have on every visit</span> (as she does with every repeat guest!) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the pool is simply relaxation at its best!Highly recommended</span></div><div class='text-box'>Great hotel, deserves its reputation <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Really great location next to luxury shopping mall</span> and park. We stayed in the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>lowest category room</span> (deluxe peakview) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>had no complaints</span>. Service was excellent, staff couldn't do enough for us and our 2 kids, great welcome. Breakfast amazing, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>loved the outdoor pool</span> - a great stay.</div><div class='text-box'>Excellent This place is great. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>welcome was impressive</span>, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>location is great above Pacific place</span> and the MTR station.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were spacious</span>, clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>had everything you could ask for</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Staff are very polite</span> and efficient.Highly recommended.</div><div class='text-box'>top of the line but you pay for it showReview(3417094, 'full');</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has a level of homely comfort, but sometimes lack small personal touches, The hotel is connected to a subway and sits above the Pacific Place shopping mall.</span><span id="1" class="summary-sentence">, however it can take a while to travel to the business district.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are really modern but unfortunately lacking in style and space.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The hotel has a cafe that provides lunch but it was really expensive and equally as disappointing, however you can get drinks from the bar that's in the foyer.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The hotel had good facilities available, such as a gym and a pool.</span></div></div>
