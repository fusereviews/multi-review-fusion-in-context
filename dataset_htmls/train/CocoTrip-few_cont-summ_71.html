<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Great old hotel in a great location I stayed at the Ambassador a week ago and had a wonderful time! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>I did have one of the infamous windowless rooms</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel is an old renovated warehouse of sorts</span>) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>but the ambiance of the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>authentic New Orleans decor</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>(exposed brick, high ceilings, wood floors) made it almost seem like being in old France</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is located close to everything</span> there is in New Orleans and a close stumble to Bourbon St. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>I found the valet staff to be prompt and friendly</span> even though they were busy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the front desk staff was quick to attend to any request with a smile</span>. I am definetly staying at this hotel next time I am in New Orleans, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I am curious to see how wonderful the renovations will turn out</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>Great spot, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>great rate</span>, great effort! Just returned from stay for French Quarter Fest. As we arrived, a bus was dropping off a full load of European students to stay at the hotel. Despite the sudden rush, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>we were checked in cheerfully and quickly</span>. Everyone went out of their way. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Location is great</span> for getting to (or away from) Quarter craziness or Garden District, and Warehouse <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>area has its own charm and eateries</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Room was comfortable and quiet, if a bit dark</span>. Bandito's off the lobby great for delicious breakfast with no wait (!) or tequila any time. We'd recommend the Ambassador to anyone traveling to NoLa for biz or pleasure.</div><div class='text-box'>Got Bugs? The room service advertised is a joke.unless you like greasy Mexican food. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>cleaning in the rooms was horrible</span>;<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> barely vacuumed or dusted in almost 2 weeks</span> of staying there and the bathroom was just barely cleaned everyday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The management is lacking and not too interested in customer service</span>. My roommate was chewed up by some <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5 8'>bugs in her bed</span> and was left with huge welts that itched and oozed. Since it was booked through Expedia.com, there was nothing that they would do except take off the mandatory $4.95 phone surcharge (although that was pretty cool, since all local and continental long distance charges were included in that).It was a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>big disappointment from start to finish</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Welcoming and friendly staff, elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel</span>, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>local restaurants</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains.</span> My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>(the steamboat tours, downtown New Orleans, The French Quarter</span>, etc).When I return, I would definitely go back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>AMBASSADOR HOTEL, NEW ORLEANS Please be advised when booking at this hotel to request a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>room with a window. Ours did not have one and the door into the room was the only way out. Had there been a fire my husband and I would have been dead. I am wondering how these rooms ever passed code</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>inexpensive rates</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>free parking</span> were not bargain enough for the potential danger.</div><div class='text-box'>Buyer Beware Stayed during a convention. It is as kindly as I can put it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>a dump</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4 5'>The rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>horrid,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4 5'>poorly kept and bad condition</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>mattresses, boxsprings and pillows looked as if they were purchased from a Katerina Auction</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The service was comical</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>even though it states they serve breakfast they only serve coffee and pastries</span>. Could not wait to check out.</div><div class='text-box'>Once is Too Much If you enjoy <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>fraternity house decor</span>, you'll love the Ambassador. No extra charge for the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 5'>beat-up furniture</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'> lightless broom closet rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>and paper thin walls</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>Hotels like the Ambassador don't count on repeat business</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>There are much better hotel options in New Orleans</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Had a Great Stay Just wanted to say that I had a great time at the Ambassador in New Orleans <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The rooms were great</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>housekeeping was great</span>, very polite and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Dave Smith the room manager was excellent with everything I needed</span>. Hope to go back soon. Thanks</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">With it being an old, renovated warehouse, this is not your typical hotel and the decor may not suit all tastes.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">However, as it is still a work in progress the rates are competitive.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This hotel's location is unbeatable because there are lots of charming places to eat and</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">lots of local classic sights are nearby.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in this hotel are generally windowless, horrible and in bad condition.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">They were not very clean and the furnishings are in need of replacement.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Management at this hotel was less than interested in customer service but the valet staff were prompt and friendly and front desk staff were prompt to help with a smile.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel claims to serve breakfast but only serve pastries and coffee.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The beds contained bugs and though the rates were low and the parking free it was not worth it.</span></div></div>
