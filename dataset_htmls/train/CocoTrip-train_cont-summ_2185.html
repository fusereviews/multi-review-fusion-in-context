<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I've been in this hotel for 3 nights on the beginning of June 2010 with my girlfriend. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was small</span>, as almost everyone in London but it was what we expected. Small, but clean and suficient for everything we needed. There was some noise during the night because our room was next to the elevator. We heard lot of noises coming from the floor of the room upstairs. The noise was really what we disliked more. The best was the location. We could go by foot to 2 metro stations (victoria and pimlico) and we could go by foot to central places like big ben or buckingham palace (20 minute walk). Belgrave road is full of hotels and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it's a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3'>very good place</span> to start your trip in London.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed two nights at the Best Western Corona in London, and managed to have almost two completely different experiences. First night - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>incredibly loud</span> (doors slamming well past midnight and the walls are very thin), <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>followed by</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 3 4'>a forgotten wake-up call</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>(no alarm clock in the room</span>). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Lucky we made it for our trip</span> to Paris <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>early the next morning</span>. Front desk employee's response? "Hmph" Second night - much quieter, and we got our wake-up call. Another issue - the shower's hot water ran out each morning before the end of the first person's shower (we are a family of 3). Rooms were clean, and convenient location. However, would look elsewhere when we return to London.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms here must be the smallest in all Europe</span>! We were first assigned room no. G01. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>When we opened the toilet, it was smelly</span> and blotted! We were then moved to 401. The TV was a 12 inch black box, born before the war! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>My wife and I are still debating which was smaller-the table fan or the shower cubicle</span>! One small suitcase is all you can fit into this pigeon hole. The breakfast-or what goes by that name-is an insult to all England. Imagine, they don't serve eggs. That's fine by me. But they don't even keep pepper! Worst of all, the staff was always grumpy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>After this we have decided to blackball all Best Western hotels!</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This was a decent hotel</span> for the price we paid. It was in a good location.we could see the London eye from our room, it was just a few minutes from the Plimlico tube, and pretty close to other attractions. The hotel did provide breakfast which helped saved some money, however, their selection of breakfast items were slim pickings. The receptions were very helpful, the only negative thing I have to say is that the hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms were tiny</span>. Also, wifi is free at the hotel; however, we could never get signal from our room which was on the 4th floor, so we had to always go to the lobby since it had a stronger signal.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Best Western Corona in the middle of May and the reason why we stayed there is because of all the reviews on Trip Advisor. Yay for you! Anyway, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the room is small</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'> but very clean</span> and I find that more important. The smallness of the room didn't matter, as we only used it to sleep in. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>I loved the location</span>. We were very near to the sights, but it was in a quiet neighborhood. The bus stand was just down the street, so we could get to where we were going very easily. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>We will definitely stay there again</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed at the Corona Hotel for one night. Having arrived early in the morning, the room was not ready yet, but the front desk gentleman was very kind, and invited me to eat breakfast compliments of the hotel. When I came back in the afternoon, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the room was</span> clean, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very small</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The bathroom also was very</span> clean, but again very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>small</span>. It had the smallest corner sink I had ever seen, I did not know they were manufactured that small. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Overall, for one night in London, if you are using the place to just sleep, it was just fine</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We chose Corona because of the reviews here, stating that the hotel was relatively clean. This turned out to be true, so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>we won't complain</span> about that. In fact we won't complain about a lot; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>we got what we payed for which was a basic London budgetclass hotel</span>. The breakfast was ok, but not any more than that. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room was small</span>, placed on lower ground floor (I call that a cellar), but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>everything was clean,</span> which was what we wanted in the first place.</div><div class='text-box'>really good location, handy to victoria station. Nice pubs and restaurants in the vicinity. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Rooms</span> basic, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>quite small</span>. We were beside the dining room which we found very noisy as we could hear the staff at 6.45am! As a group of 3 we always had a wait to get a table together at breakfast. But for al the time you spend in a hotel when you are sight seeing in london <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>this was a grand choice and good value for money</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The room was the smallest, smelliest and most expensive place we have ever been in.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">What a disappointment in the Hotel.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The bathroom was so small and the room was wedged in between the elevator and the cleaners room.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Could not wait to get out of there.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The experience dampened our trip tremendously.</span></div></div>
