<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We were originally due to stay for 10 nights and we booked for three people - my teenager daughter and her friend and myself. On arrival in the room <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the beds were very small double beds and only two of them</span> - I spoke to the manager who said that all the rooms were exactly the same (untrue) and that for an extra $10 we could have a rollaway bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are far too small for more than two people</span>. The site is not well maintained and the pool not clean. We were then stranded due to the volcano and having enquired about staying for an additional five nights <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>was told that we could have a special price of $39 per night</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>- only to find out on the website for the hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>that the cost</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>for that period of time</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 6'>would be $32 per night</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Scammed! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone</span> - there are far better places to stay which are closer to the amenities.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and both times have been totally trouble free</span>. We stayed for 10 nights and had no problems. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was clean and was cleaned every day, towels and bed sheets changed we came back every day to a spotless room</span>. We only seen reception staff to check in and out but they seemed friendly enough and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>there were no additional charges over what we paid when we booked</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is exellent</span>, took <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>about 10 mins to get to disney</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>about 20 mins to Universal and Seaworld</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Aircon</span> and tv <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>worked well</span> and there was always a parking space outside our room despite the hotel being quite busy over spring break. I will definatly stay here again if back in Orlando :)</div><div class='text-box'>The "Hotel" is actually like something straight out of My Name is Earl. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Filthy carpets,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>bugs</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>in the refridgerator and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>all over the room</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Horrendously misrepresented by the pictures on the website</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the bbq area and lagoon are disgraceful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I paid for 2 star Quality</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would never stay here, recommend it, etc</span>. In fairness the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff are very friendly and all issues raised were dealt with</span>, they seem to know with the quality of their resort, they HAVE to provide good service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Bar is very reasonable, with Long Island Iced tea recommended</span>.

The shuttle was not so confy, because run for 3 hotels, but Champions is the first so you can have a seat haha. If you have a car, fine, because if you don't have a car you don't have many alternatives to eat. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I like this hotel and really recomend it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>This hotel is near to a Chinese buffett, Dominos Pizza, Pizza Hut</span>, Walgreens, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>McDonalds</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>one of my favorite hotels in Kissimmee</span>.
