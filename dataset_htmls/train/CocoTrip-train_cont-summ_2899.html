<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and our extended family <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>stayed at the Americana Hotel</span> - Condos - located on 6th street and found it to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>a very satisfactory hotel</span> despite some of the negative reviews. The condos is relatively new. We were told that it was built in 2005. We believed it. The three bedroom condos was clean, spacious, and reasonably priced. The condo is one block away from the boardwall too - which is nice. The staff members are exceptionally friendly and made both the check in and check out processes easy and quick. They even gave us an extra parking permit because we had multiple cars that need to be parked. Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel-condo and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others. Just be sure to ask for a condo.</div><div class='text-box'>After trusting my friends word that the hotel was okay despite reading the reviews i booked a side view room for 99 dollars a night. When we arrived at 2pm we asked if we could check in early and was allowed. We had come with another family but they had a different room. My two kids and I had a room on the 5th floor and it was room number 513. It had a great view for being sideview. Our maid would do anything we asked her to. Although she never cleaned the balcony window like we asked. It was pretty clean, quiet, and nice. Our air conditioner had its wires crossed we found out after telling the desk it wouldnt work. Overall <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 9'>we liked the americana hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>and plan on going back</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We checked in 2different rooms on Monday. The first room the sink was clogged, toilet would not flush, and the ac didn't work. 2nd room the phone and ac would not work. A member if both of our families advised of the problems and was told it would be fixed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Someone</span> also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>tried breaking in</span> by removing the lock on the first rooms door (they never fixed lock after that incident). It got so hot in the rooms we has to leave the balcony doors open. Upon checking out we asked how they would make up for our horrible stay and they didn't care justvsaid they would have the maintenance man fix the problems. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>DO NOT WASTE your money to stay at this nasty nasty place</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>The price was right and the location was perfect</span> so we picked this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We chose the Americana</span> farthest south in OC, the one without a pool. We could have used the pool at the northern Americana but we never tend to swim in indoor pools and that's all they offer there. The location is perfect, you are walking distance to everything on the Boardwalk and right at the Kite Loft which tends to be an ideal spot for kids. This part of the beach offers playgrounds for the kids every few blocks, we love the FREE fun! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>The staff was ok</span>, they were exchange students and not really the most helpful, but they were fine.</div><div class='text-box'>I was told about this hotel through a friend of my fiance and i have to say after reading the reviews I was going to cancel, but after deciding to try the place out, I'm glad we didnt. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The place was great</span>, the rooms were nice and clean and the view from my room spectacular, and the staff was very nice, not to mention the price we paid to be right on the broadwalk was a steal, the only complaint I have is that you need a strong man to open the balcony door and the water pressure was low. Other than that, this is a place I'd recommend to anyone!</div><div class='text-box'>I wish I had seen these reviews before. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>Do not stay here</span>. Key cards did not work, toilet backed up, air conditioner would not cool room, no hot water in the mornings, looked liked someone throwup on the hallway wall beside elevator and no one cleaned it our entire 3 day stay. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Remote for tv would not work</span>. Out of the three chairs in the room two had so many stains neither my wife our I would use them. The elevator had trash on top of the light grills the entire time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Eveything was dirty and dusty</span>. Great location but not much else. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>Stay away from here</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'></span></div><div class='text-box'>IWe had a game down at the ocean so we decided to stay at the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>cheap "ok" hotel</span>. Upon checking in we were asked to pay in advance for our weekend stay. Fine. BUT on sunday when we were checkinhg out we could not because we paid until monday? Our game was finished we did not make the playoffs. Susan was not helpful all she had to say is I'll take you room key if your leaveing! WTF! Why would anyone pay 131.50 just to pay it?</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Just stayed there</span> July23rd-25th and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It was</span> a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>MORE then what I expected for my money</span>.Everyone was very nice to us and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 9'>we had NO problems at all</span>.The room was very clean and the room was large. Not to mention your right on the boardwalk. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>I will stay here again!</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">We stayed at the Americana Hotel on 10th.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">St.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">it was the worst hotel we ever stayed in.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">When we got to the room none of the lights would go on</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">i had to find the plugs to plug them in.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The microwave did not work the shower knob was broken and the water poured out like a jet.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">There was no remote for the tv.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Our balcony was above the garbage so every night at 2:30 we would be woken up to bottles being dumped in the cans and not to mention the smell.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">When we were in the elevator it stopped and the alarm went off.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">We will not be returning to this hotel!</span></div></div>
