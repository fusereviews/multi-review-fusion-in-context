<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I read many negative reviews after I made a non-refundable reservation for two nights. SO.I took all the negative comments to heart and when I checked in, I specifically asked for a refurbished, quiet room. Supposedly there are some rooms with antiquated furniture and lots of noise, I waited a few hours to check in, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the room was</span> very nice, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>small</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>but nice flat screen tv, modern furniture, comfortable king-size bed</span> and no noise even though we were near the elevator. I also got a coupon for free appetizer and $50 food and beverage credit. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything in the hotel is expensive</span> and Canada has a ton of tax on everything but the food was good and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>place is gorgeous</span> but be aware, parking was $42 a night. Absurd.</div><div class='text-box'>This review is a little late I know, however we have beeen constantly travelling since our stay in early Sept. I note all the other reviews regarding dated property and poor hotel standards and I also note the constant apologies from Hotel Management, however with so many poor reviews why don't they fix the problems, then they wouldn't have to keep apologing. I won't repeat all the comments from so many poor reviews other than so say, that was our experience as well. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>For the price,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>poor hotel</span>, poor value for money, there are better options in Toronto.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed at Royal York for 3 nights at start of a trans Canada tour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The lobby etc. of the hotel are very grand</span> and imposing and well worth seeing, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Our room was the smallest one of any of the hotels</span> we stayed at during trip, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>although it had the normal two large beds</span>, there was not a lot of room around them. Dark furniture and small window did not add to the rooms appearance. Having said this we enjoyed our time here but if we ever return to Toronto will try somewhere else.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed one night because of the hotel's convenient Porter Airline shuttle available outside the hotel's door. Staff was attentive and helpful, however the lines for the Concierge were long. Lovely restaurants in the hotel and there is an underground mall under the hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is a little expensive</span> and parking is very expensive <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>but the location is terrific</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Rooms are small but comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel is large</span> and hallways are very long. Only complaint, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>typical of expensive hotels,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3 4'>you must pay $16 for internet access</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Located in heart of downtown near financial district and train station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Historic hotel with grand lobby</span> and lots of atmosphere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Rooms small but clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Service good</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> excellent concierge</span>. Can be pricey, try to get a deal online, worth about 150 to 250 per night depending on time of year and size of room you get.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel on 9th Aug for three nights.It is superbly located in the tourist area of Toronto. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived in the hotel</span>.We stayed on the gold floor with breakfast included this was outstanding we would highly recommend this hotel for <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>a truly fantastic first class hotel</span> in Torronto.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>An upgrade to an enormous suite</span>, fresh fruit and workout clothes waiting for me, 5pm check out, free shuttle to city airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Very Royal indeed</span>!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The service was impecabble</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>But</span> the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>small and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>DIRTY</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>You can see dust everywhere</span>!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is really grand and gave a very royal vibe, and even treats you like royalty too.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The room was fairly small and a little dirty in places but it featured large comfortable beds and a good flat-screen television.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Overall it's a great hotel but it has one big flaw and</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">that is you have to pay quite a bit of money just for internet access.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">This is unfortunately typical of most expensive hotels.</span></div></div>
