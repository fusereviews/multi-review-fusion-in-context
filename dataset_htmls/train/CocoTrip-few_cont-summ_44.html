<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed here during Mardi Gras and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>couldnt ask for a better location</span>. St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building</span> which is good because that means randoms cant go in. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room is equipped with a small kitchen</span> which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>it's a good base to explore New Orleans</span> with the trolley right outside your door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter.probably</span> 30 minutes to 40 minutes. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms could be updated</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the staff was very helpful</span> even during the stressful Mardi Gras time (super busy for them) It also had a very spacious and updated gym to burn those calories off from all the good food you eat in New Orleans</div><div class='text-box'>From the time we stepped out of our car to hand over our keys to the time we left we were treated like royalty. The porters, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and made us feel most welcome</span> especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>studio with a king bed and full kitchen, dressing area and shower</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>All were very clean</span>. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>Resort is in a residential area right on the St. Charles trolley line</span>. We purchased a Jazzy Pass at Walgreens down the street and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>never needed our car</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My daughter and I spend a weekend here while job hunting, school interviewing and house hunting. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>This was the perfect home base for all of our explorations</span>. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying outside of the Quarter. It was wonderful! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was amazing, so very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>were spacious</span> and well appointed, the beds very comfortable and everything <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>upgraded and modern</span>. Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy. Would recommend this to anyone visiting this amazing city!</div><div class='text-box'>WOW - looking via the internet I was looking forward to staying at the Avenue Plaza. Too bad there was no information about them being timeshares. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is great</span> - right on the St. Charles streetcar line. But <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>we didn't get fresh towels, the beds were not made up,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the floors were dirty</span>.NOT what you want to see when you are traveling, especially when you know there are so many hotels in NO that are way classier. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would not recommend staying here at all</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The staff was very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot</span>. The bathroom was small, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>everything worked</span>; <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>it was clean</span>, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>Great location for bar/ restaurant hopping on St Charles</span>, nice and clean pool, fantastic steak house on site! Fun 24/7 bar next door for karaoke. Loved my stay for my birthday. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Walk down to the Blind Pelican for drinks</span>, 15$ taxi to quarter, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 2'>great shopping on Magazine st</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Staff were very friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Rooms were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>large</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and well appointed with tv, kitchenette, etc</span>. Great shower. Even though this is a timeshare there was no pressure to buy. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>All staff went out of there way to be helpful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a wonderful place to stay in a beautiful section of New Orleans</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Fine dining and transportation all within walking distance</span>. Well worth the money, I will stay here again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">If you can get a room which isn't overbooked this is a great place to base yourself to explore this amazing place.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Excellent location as it is central to many of the major attractions in this area.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">You can simply walk to get to many places, and it is a great base to start at before going to explore what else there is on offer in the area.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Rooms are very spacious with all amenities that are needed for a good night's stay.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are slightly outdated but still look reasonably modern and are maintained to a good standard.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Extremely friendly and helpful staff at this hotel, who are very attentive to the needs of their guests and go above and beyond to make them feel welcome.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Hotel security requires seeing wristbands provided to its guests in order to enter the building.</span></div></div>
