<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Cheapest decent hotel in Chicago that I could find. Nice large room which was pretty modern looking considering the age of the building. Appreciated the free WiFi and the fact that you have to swipe your key to get on the elevator or stairs- extra security (though somehow the pizza delivery guy was able to get up to our room, must have an agreement with the hotel.) Street noise didn't bother me too much. Breakfast was great, although the room was a little cramped. The only complaint I have is that its hard to pull up to the front of the hotel to get valet parking ($22/24 hours) Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here by myself the night before a group tour and got a single room, which came with a double bed. The sheets are soft and there four pillows on the bed! Awesome. The room is perfect for one or two people. The area is great, although not serviceable by the train, it has buses to the city. The area itself is really upbeat, with a young crowd. Great little shops, restaurants and bars. I'd stay here again for sure if I were in Chicago. It's a nice alternative to the large downtown hotels.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my first trip to Chicago and Days Inn made it even better! It is a great bargain especially for the location. The hotel was clean, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff was so darn nice</span>, the free bfast was mmm soo good- the muffins were amazing, fresh squeezed juice, and even make your own waffles. The only complaint is the drain in the shower wasn't working as smoothly as it should have been. I can't see how anything could go wrong here and even if it did, front desk was just so ncie!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The staff at this hotel were extremely gracious</span> and went out of their way to welcome me. I arrived early and the staff had a room cleaned and ready for me promptly. Property is located right in the heart of Lincoln Park and there are numerous dining and nightlife options at the property doorstep. I will definitely return to this property. The Days Inn brand gets a serious upgrade in my mind with properties of this character.</div><div class='text-box'>Travelled with a friend for a quick getaway. We were in a room with 2 beds, fridge, & micro(we were in room 403), room with views of Clark St. As always it was a great stay, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff very friendly, and willing to help in any way possible</span>. If your not a continental b-fast kind-of-person, I would suggest The Golden Nugget one block south of Diversey on Clark.</div><div class='text-box'>This old Days Inn is in the heart of Lincoln Park and a short walk to Boys Town.The hotel was clean and the free breakfeast was a big hit. My only complait are the bathrooms. Time to upgrade! They all have this 3 inch step up which is just great to trip over at 3 am in the dark. Other then that this is a nice hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 15 years. It is quiet, clean, moderately priced, and very conveniently located near several bus lines. Clark Street, on which it is located, is a major shopping street, and there is parking at the nearby Century Mall. I have <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>found the staff to be friendly</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>helpful</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We booked this hotel for a girl's trip to Chicago. I booked solely on written reviews.and boy were we impressed! For the price, this hotel is PERFECT! The beds were great, rooms were very clean, breakfast was the best.waffles.YUMMY.and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff was so helpful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly</span>! Great location to public transportation. Highly recommend this property!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The staff are always willing to help with their friendly attitude.</span></div></div>
