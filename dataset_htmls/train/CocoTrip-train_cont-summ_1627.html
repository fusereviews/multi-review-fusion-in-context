<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel was in a decent location</span>, but my boyfriend and I were both <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>treated rudely by the front desk staff</span> and had several problems in our room. To get my 21-year-old boyfriend's attention as we walked out the hotel, the man at the front desk yelled "Hey little boy" across the lobby. On another occasion, we returned from a long day of walking around Rome in the rain to discover that we had no hot water in our room. Additionally, we could not get the air in our room to blow cool no matter what we did, including switching on the AC and turning it to the coolest setting. Overall, this hotel is overpriced for what it provides and I would recommend staying elsewhere.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in a single room at the Torino Hotel in Rome which is classified as a 4 star. The single room is very small and the batroom although very clean is too small . To close or open the bathroom door one has to make sure to be out of the way as otherwise, there will not be enough room to enter. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room is so small</span> that there was hardly any space to put the luggauge aside. Definetley this hotel should not be classified as a 4 star. The price was over rated . The only possitive thing about the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel</span> that it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>is</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>central</span> and convenient . As for the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>staff</span> they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>were very helpfull</span> . The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast was</span> also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>good</span>. Derek Mifsud Speranza. Malta</div><div class='text-box'>I stated for 2 nights 26th/27th Jan. with colleagues to attend a conference and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we found the staff to be surly and unhelpful(they need to learn how to smile),the</span> first morning there was no hot water in the Hotel and despite the guests complaining there was none until the afternoon and then it was only warm. the Hotel is old fashioned the. rooms dark and the beds uncomfortable,The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Saving grace</span> for the Hotel is that it was very clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the cold buffet breakfast was plentiful and acceptable</span>.It could be only be classed as a Budget Hotel,fortunately for ourselves we were'nt paying the bill. I would'nt return to it for either business or leisure and won't be reccommending it to anyone else</div><div class='text-box'>On arrival we were met by a friendly member of <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>staff</span> who <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was polite</span>, efficient and took the time to show us where the various sites were on the map. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room</span> on the 6th floor which had an east facing window, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was small</span> but was the only hotel (1 of 4) on our holiday that had a double matress. All the others were 2 singles. Breakfast on the terrace was excellent and the terrace could be used for sun lounging if you asked the staff to unlock the door! Very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>convenient for the sights and</span> also had a lot of convenience <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>stores</span> for those essentials <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>nearby</span>. We would stay here again.</div><div class='text-box'>We arrived in Rome after a cruise of the Greek Islands. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The hotel is well located</span> and was clean and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>staff friendly</span>. Nice touches.crisp linen hand towels in the baths, cold <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast</span> on the rooftop <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was delicious</span>.The hotel has some recent renovations. The staff helped arrange our tours. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We were surprised the bar just off the lobby was not open either night of our stay</span>. They finally open it at 7:30 pm one evening just as we were leaving for dinner. One word of caution.watch out for the step at the landing of the main stairway. I slipped and my head crashed into the marble steps.</div><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed in this hotel , for a night before our cruise. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>hotel is in a</span> very tourist <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>convenient locale</span>. It is quiet close to the central train station and also in the middle of the ancient Rome. It is actually situated, very close to the colloseum. The rooms are ok , though could have been better . The bathroom was neat and clean. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast was</span> provided in the restaurant at the terrace. The food was very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>good</span>. Overall, the hotel is a little over priced , but nevertheless a good choice , just for the location.</div><div class='text-box'>This is not a 4* hotel,. The rooms are shabby. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Rain leaking</span> through the ceiling into the bathroom <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>was met with indifference by the hotel Reception staff - as was the burst hose on the hair dryer- a shrug and "yes, we know".</span> Don't expect any other service apart from breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The bar is never open</span> and it is impossible to get tea, coffee etc other than at breakfast time. The rooms were very clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast was OK</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>It is in a good position for the Termini with buses to all areas</span>, saving on taxis.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at Hotel Torino for a week with our children aged 10 and 12 - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the room was more like an apartment with a separate room for the kids</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff were always helpful</span> - happily brought a pot of tea to our room. The bathroom was large and clean. The shower took a while to heat up but was eventually fine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfasts were generous and the roof top dining a lovely experience</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The location was fantastic</span> with many affordable restaurants less than 100 metres away and walking distance to all the sites. Definately recommend Hotel Torino.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The room was a tiny, inside room with a view of the hotel air vent!</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">We could not leave the window open.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the front desk was snotty.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">the bar was never open.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The location was ok and the breakfast was the best part of the stay.</span></div></div>
