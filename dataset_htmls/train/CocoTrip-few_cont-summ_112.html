<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>This hotel is situated at around 10 min by cab from the center (barrio gotico). Must be max 10 years old. Can be reached also by tram or metro. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Rooms are clean</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'> beds a bit hard</span>. Bar is OK and the patio too but mostly in the shadom in the evening. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Rooms that had a sea view don't have it anymore</span> (see previous reviews). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>A bit expensive for the location</span> and the lack of view (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>my room had a view on a skeleton building</span> (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all). The pool on the 17th is not heated, so quite difficult to swim at this time of the year, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>nice view on the utility building</span> on the other side and on the sea and beach, plus power plant for the rest.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms</span> and prices <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>looked good</span> and the pool looked attractive <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>online, however the reality was different</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I booked a family room which is really 2 separate bedrooms next to each other behind another door for privacy which was meant to lock but didn't.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>My kids room smelt like someone had smoked 100 cigarettes in it</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and had drugs and booze on the table when we checked in.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>They cleaned but the smell didn't go away for all 3 days</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 5'>they would not change the rooms</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The pool is</span> tiny and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>over crowded</span> with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. Well done for offering free WiFi but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating. Overall it is good value but it is most suited to weekend getaways for young party couples or mates.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in the diagonal zero for 4 nights while attending a congress. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The area near the hotel is not nice</span>, however, the metro station is nearby and you can visit the centre in a few minutes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3 4'>rooms are spacious</span>, mattress is moderate, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>views are poor</span>. The decoration is modern but on the poor side. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Breakfast was ok</span>, but i consider it unacceptable to drink disgusting coffee from a machine in a 4 star hotel.it shows lack of respect for the client. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The Personnel was very polite</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>There is a very good gym in the hotel</span> and free wifi which is very important.</div><div class='text-box'>We only stayed one night but had most of 2 days sightseeing in Barcelona with fairly grown up family in 2 bedrooms. Hotel happy to look after our luggage. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Perhaps in an area a bit far from the character of Barcelona</span>, but very convenient for tram and subway. Also large shopping centre close by with lots of dining choice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Pool a bit crowded as our trip was in the heat of August</span> and slightly disappointing that they charged for towel use. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Very helpful porter showed us control panel for lights/aircon etc</span> - all very hi-tech.</div><div class='text-box'>Recently stayed here and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very impressed with this hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Friendly staff</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>good clean rooms and quiet</span> so sleep no problem. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The beach is with 10 mins walking distance from the hotel</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>5 mins walk from a great shopping mall Diagonal Mar where there are lots of great restaurants</span>. The metro is a 2 min walk and a 10 min journey or 6 stops to the centre of the city with no changes. We loved it!</div><div class='text-box'>I stay for 3 nights in a business trip, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the hotel is beautiful and the room was suburb</span>. Its far from the city town but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>have the beach nearby</span> and a subway station pretty close. For sure I will come back again</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed for five nights at this hotel for a conference. By the end <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we couldn't wait to leave</span> due to the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>monotonous breakfast</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>below par cleanliness, and cold decor</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wonderful hotel</span> just a short metro ride away from Barcelona attractions, with gorgeous rooftop pool. Excellent customer service.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel provides a really impressive stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located within ten minutes walk from the beach and around five minutes away from a shopping mall and restaurants.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is a little expensive for the location as it is not in the centre of Barcelona.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are very unsatisfactory for the most part.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Some are spacious but views are less than great, the room smelled of cigarettes and the representation of the rooms online was not accurate.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff were polite and helpful but also really friendly and approachable when requiring help with any issues.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was okay but not much selection.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's pool can be a bit crowded at times but the gym facilities are excellent.</span></div></div>
