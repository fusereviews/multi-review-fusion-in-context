<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Stayed at the Hotel La Forcola 4 nights during our trip to the Venice region. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4 6'>The room was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>clean, quiet and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 4 6'>comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Staff was nice enough</span>, but not overly friendly. The room we stayed in was small, but we were still able to move around quite well. We requested a balcony and recieved one on the canal side. The bathroom was quite small, especially the shower, but it felt great after the long trip from the U.S. ( reguardless of the amount of water on the floor!). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Breakfast was good</span> (croissants, cake, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>yogurt, cereal</span>, coffee, juice, water, nutella, jam.). Overall it was a nice stay and would book there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for 2 nights on our honeymoon. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We thought the location was really good</span>, easy walking distance to st marks square and good shopping nearby but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we were disappointed with the hotel itself</span>. The staff weren't very friendly and seemed grumpy all the time! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We paid extra and got a canal view room and the view was nice but the room was nothing special</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 6'>The bed was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>2 singles pushed together</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>uncomfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>and the bathroom was dirty</span> and tiny, we even saw a cockroach or 2 running on the floor! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Breakfast was basic but not bad</span> and the coffee was good. I don't think we would come back to this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my first trip to Venice and if this hotel is a representation of the quality of hotels in the $200 a night range I will stay across the bridge next time. The ambiance is just "old". The only other postive things are that the staff is mostly patient, speak good English and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the location is fair- 15 min walk from the train</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The beds, pillows and linens were very old</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The mattresses were very hard and the pillows did not bend</span>. Wake up calls didn't happen. There was a pidgeon nesting in the bathroom window and the window sill was in disrepair. TV has no English channels.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was fantastic</span>. We arrived at the train station and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>took the waterbus two stops and then a very short walk</span> (easy to find) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to the hotel</span>. When we left the hotel two days later we walked back to the train station. It really is close enough to walk even if you're dragging a bag or two. The area is perfect for walking everywhere which is what we did. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We loved how clean the hotel</span> was, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the staff were very helpful</span>, everything was just great. We found great restaurants close by and totally recommend this place for all kinds of travellers.</div><div class='text-box'>While the staff was friendly, we did not get breakfast as we had to leave before they served breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was good</span> but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the room was not worth it</span>. We stayed in many hostels that were far better! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The room was dark and so musky</span>, when you walked into the bathroom, the source of the musky smell was apparent. Along the top of 2 walls and on the ceiling was very large portions of black mold! Both ended up sick after one night of staying here! Will not ever stay here again. Will find a hostel next time.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed here for 4 days. It had to be the worst hotel we stayed in. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>rooms were bad</span>, the hotel staff very unfriendly and not helpful at all. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>breakfast was terrible</span> and very basic. The only positive about this hotel was that is was a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>10 minute walk from the main train station</span>. There were better <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>hotels in the area at much better prices</span>. Too far from San Marco's Square. Avoid this hotel. The hotel staff needs training on how to interact with tourists. Definitely will not recommend this hotel to anyone.</div><div class='text-box'>We loved this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The location was great</span>. Very nice in the morning when the market vendors opened up. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 6'>The room was clean</span>. The shower was small but where in Italy isn't the shower small. I recommend it highly! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Front desk staff was great</span>. We didn't have a reservation and just walked up. We loked being off the beaten path. It wasn't until our last night that we realized the grand canal was only a three minute walk out the front door.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this hotel was very well situated to use as a base</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with the San Marcuola waterbus stop very nearby</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The room suited our needs</span> for the stay, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>and we found the hotel a pleasant place to stay in</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff were courteous and helpful</span>, and the rooms were kept well. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Breakfasts were good</span> and gave us a good start to the day.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The location of this hotel was very well positioned, only a couple minutes walk from the station.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Breakfast was ok, with cereals, yogurts and fruit.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">However, this was the only real positive attributes about the hotel.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The air conditioner in the room leaked water onto the floor and created a nice puddle right by the door.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The bed was very uncomfortable as were the pillows.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Luckily we did not spend too much time in the hotel.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Overall while the hotel was fairly priced due to its location and breakfast, we were quite disappointed with the condition of the room.</span></div></div>
