<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Olimpia over the new year holiday for four nights. It is everything it claims to be and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>it looks just like the photos on the website</span>. The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room staff was great too. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Hotel is located about a minutes walk from the vaporetto station</span>. You should buy an extended vaporetto pass if you are going to be in town for a stretch of time. The railway station was a short three minute walk away, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>St. Mark's Square took about 1 hour at a leisurely pace to reach</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 5'>Hotel is</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>quietly situated</span>, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>well located for the</span> trains, buses and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>vaporetto</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is very clean and comfortable with friendly and efficient staff</span>. Excellent selection for breakfast. I developed a health problem whilst in Venice and the reception staff could not have been more helpful and supportive in assisting me to resolve the matter. I would certainly stay at this hotel if we return to Venice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Our only criticism would be that the room was a little on the small side</span> but as we spent a great deal of time sightseeing it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>If you are cruising, this a great location. We walked from cruise terminal to Piaza Roma</span>. The hotel is visible from the Piaza. You can get to the airport by bus, cab, or water taxi practically from the front door. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The room was small but had a nice view</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>We left the window and shutters open and it still was not too noisy</span>, although there is activity going on almost all night. Small but usable elevator, which you don't always get. The location and ease of travel made it worth the price.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This hotel was very nice</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The room was quite beautiful</span>, very large by Venice standards, with a canal view and good breakfast. The only complaint is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it is near the end of a vaparato route</span>, and too far to walk at night from San Marco (unless you are actually familiar with the streets and alleys of Venice.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The restaurant, Brucinellis, in the same building was not so great</span>. The bass was very disappointing, and I believe they refill the water bottles with tap water.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>A 3 euro ticket from the airport takes you to Plaza da Roma in 15 mins</span>, you can see the hotel as you get off the bus, A 2 minute walk up steps along small bridge and down steps brings you to Hotel Olimpia. We arrived at Marco Polo at 9p.m by 10p.m we had checked in and were eating <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>supper</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 6 7'>overlooking canal by hotel-magical</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4 6'>Rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>very pretty</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>not big</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> but comfortable.Breakfast plentiful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9 10'>Very convenient for leaving luggage there when checking out</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'></span>Would definetly stay there again, not cheap though.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a good hotel</span>, cold air conditioning, warm and friendly staff, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>only two bridges from train station and one bridge from Water busses and Piazzaie Roma</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>They have tables with an awning outside their front door so you can</span> sit and have some wine and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>enjoy Venice</span>. A good restaurant is right next door and the staff will tell which ones in the area to avoid.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for three nights prior to our cruise, the hotel is very conveniently located transportation wise from the airport and pier. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very good. The only note is that the shower was actually smaller than the one on the ship. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>, I would stay there again and recommend it to friends.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Located close to bus station need to take 2 bridges</span> to get here from the train station. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Everything is close by in venice</span>, front-desk person was super nice and very talkative. Have to climb 4 floors to go our room, luckily the doorman helped us with the luggages. Stayed here one night and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>they stored our luggage for free</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a nice hotel that lives up to all the photos you can view on their website.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is closely located to the Vaporetto station and ideal for those tourists who are cruising.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">St. Mark's Square is about an hour's walk away.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">It is located just 15 minutes away from the airport.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are a little on the small side but do provide a nice view.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Owing to very little noise it was fine to keep the window and shutters open.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Inside the room it is beautiful.</span><span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The restaurant Brucinellis in the hotel was okay but the view overlooking the canal was great.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The photos are very reflective of how this hotel is in reality.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">It's really convenient that they let you leave your luggage there when checking-out</span> <span id="10" class="summary-sentence">so you can do other things for a while.</span></div></div>
