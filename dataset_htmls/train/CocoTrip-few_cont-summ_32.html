<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Hotel Victoria is great as a base from which to see the city. It's on Yonge Street, bonus, and is reasonably priced. Things like CN Tower, Rogers Centre/Skydome, the Eaton Centre, harbourfront, Hockey Hall of Fame, Union station and Dundas Square are all between 5 and 20 minutes' walk. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>A list of good food options in the area would have the 'Richtree market restaurant' at the top (it's also one of the closest), nice 'takesushi' place around the corner, Baton Rouge closer to Dundas square</span>. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>You don't choose hotel victoria because you want luxury</span>, nice thick walls that block out most noise, or a view of anything but a brick wall (in our room anyway), but like i said <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it has friendly staff</span>, is reasonably priced and is in a great location.</div><div class='text-box'>We got a decent deal online by having to show our concert ticket to Bon Iver at Massey Hall. The queen <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>room was</span> small but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nice</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>recently updated</span>, the hotel was in a great location about a ten minute walk to Queen street and only a few minutes from the GO station / Union. We paid a little extra for the "Business Room" which came with a bottle of water - although there was no fridge, a paper in the morning and Apple TV, which was a good to have after the show. The only faults: we were a disappointed when we asked downstairs for wine glasses on our way in, as we brought a bottle for after the show; and the pillows were a bit high/full for us - pretty minor. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast</span> down in the adjoining restaurant, Over Easy <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was great</span> in the morning.</div><div class='text-box'>stayed here for three nights. they are renovations going on at the moment in the lobby but don't let that put you off - we were on 2nd floor - newly renovated and didn't hear a thing. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>rooms are contemporary (new new blue woodedn floor</span>)<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> - clean</span> rooms but be careful as bath in slippery - they have a bath mat for you to use. would have been nice if there were a few leaflets on site seeing in toronto - there was only a niagara leaflet. Must eat in Over Easy - restaurant just walk through hotel lobby - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>they do breakfast</span>/lunch from 10am-4pm. the french toast and side of fresh fruit is magic. would recommend this hotel - hockey hall of fame is 5 minute walk - CN tower 15 mins and downtown shopping in yonge is a ten minute walk.</div><div class='text-box'>My girlfriend and I are staying here late November on an extended business trip. (for the first time) Before we have even stayed there, I can say I am more than satisfied with the service at this Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>I sent an email to the Sales Manager with a couple of questions about the hotel and he got back to me with polite answers\suggestions in a timely manner</span>. This is officially the first time I have ever written a review before I have stayed somewhere. Looking forward to our experience there.</div><div class='text-box'>Best hotel stay I've ever had! Every year my boyfriend and I celebrate our anniversary by having a hotel night, our normal hotel was unavaliable so we looked around and immediatly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fell in love with the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>modern decor of these rooms</span>. The location was amazing, having Netflicks avaliable to us as well was wonderful, and the hotel staff were very very nice! I think my boyfriend and I have found a new hotel for our future anniversaries! To sum up my experience: it was amazing!</div><div class='text-box'>Location is perfect, just on Yonge and Wellington (close to Eaton centre for shopping and CN Tower Skydome for sightseeing). Althouigh, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>breakfast was</span> an extra cost (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>there is an over easy in the hotel</span>), this was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>quite good value</span> for money and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>a good way to start the day</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The free wi-fi in the rooms was a God send</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Room was nice</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>the shower was really good</span>. I would definitely recommend people to stay here.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed over thr weekend and was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>VERY impressed with the quality of</span> service(friendly staff) and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the great room (really clean</span>). I heard that they will be renovating in the near future and will make another reservation to see what the results are. Highly recommended</div><div class='text-box'>Convenient location downtown. The staff were courteous and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>The room was modern</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and suited our needs</span> for a one night rental.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Generally very nice rooms that offer a variety of luxuries in the higher end suites.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Each room has modern styling and decor, and the shower in particular is very good.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Not only this, but unlike some other hotels it also provides free Wi-Fi in all rooms of the hotel.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The sales manager at this hotel was very polite and prompt in responding via email when questions were posed and the rest of the staff were all very helpful and nice.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">Breakfast at the hotel was great but there is an assortment of restaurants in the area for other options and variety.</span></div></div>
