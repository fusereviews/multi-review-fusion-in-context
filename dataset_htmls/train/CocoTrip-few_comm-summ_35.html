<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in central Toronto and settled on 1 king west. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>My spouse and I</span> stayed in a superior studio suite and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were extremely satisfied with our stay</span>. I was attracted initially to the non-cookie cutter rooms typical in most hotels. The room was very modern with sophisticated looking furnishings, a very comfortable bed, nice walk-in shower and modern kitchenette. We were stationed on the 18th floor and did find the room a bit dark as our bedroom window was frosted over as it clearly faced another building in close proximity. We did not consider this an issue however because the room had so many other positives and the 'office' section of the room offered a view of the lake. My only disappointment was that there was no wi-fi (only hard-wired) so I was unable to use it.</div><div class='text-box'>This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel was spacious, quiet</span> and very clean. I would sum up the negative points of some other reviews by saying that this property is new and they are clearly still working on "opening" and getting their procedures in place. We had a glitch with our cards upon check-in and the staff upgraded us to a deluxe 2-room suite on the 44th floor with views on 3 sides. We moved to this hotel after having a bad experience at the Cosmpolitan, which is right across the street. We did not have any problems or costs involved with getting our car in and out, and another cool benefit is that the concierge staff has a fleet of vintage cars (Bentley, '60 Cadillac, Rolls) with drivers who will take you to various downtown sites for free (with an advance reservation).</div><div class='text-box'>I've stayed at this hotel several times on trips to Toronto<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>. It is in a great location. Walking distance to Eaton Centre</span>, restaurants and theatres. Parking price is a little steep at 30$ a day but will pay around that amount anywhere in T.O. The room came well equiped - washer, dryer, kitchenette and king bed. Only negative in the room was the shower which tended to leak all over the bathroom floor and was so powerful it was an extremely uncomfortable experience. This could be room-specific as I did not have this experience on my previous stays. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Overall, for the price,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>this is a great place to stay</span> in downtown T.O.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Fabulous few days in Toronto</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Hotel is in a fab location to walk to the main shopping mall and the heart of Downtown</span>. Hotel is very clean and the staff were lovely, very helpful and pleasant . The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and just right for a short city break, as we didn't spend much time in the room. The parking in the hotel was very very expensive $30 per night! We had a car for 4 nights so worked out very expensive. Lovely breakfast though but again a little overpriced.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I'd read the reviews and felt confident we'd get value.and we did</span>. A nice clean <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel in a great location for site seeing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short break to take in Torontos sites</span>. Very good. My only small gripe is I would have liked bottled water available in the room. You need to buy your own but that's a minor personal irritation. Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>everything seemed first rate .until i had to deal with the concierge.i think her name was christine. maybe she should work by herself.she seemed upset when my family requested reservations were asked to be made. but the rest of the property was outstanding. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>will stay again.just</span> wouldnt use the conceirge again.</div><div class='text-box'>This was our third time staying at this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>What brings us back</span>? Cleanliness, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>location</span> (max <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>10 minute walk to</span> Air Canada Centre, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Rogers Centre</span>, Union Station, Historic District), friendliness, quality of room, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>price</span>. Also, the concierge is really helpful.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Great Hotel</span>. I stayed for 3nights in early July with my husband and 2 teenage sons sharing 1 room. Plenty of space, 2 TVs, Very clean. Nice bar area. Frendly staff and good position. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>For the money it is hard to fault it</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel offers a lovely experience, and for an excellent price.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel's location is great in its convenience to being within walking distance of places like the Eaton Centre and is a recommended place to make your stay.</span></div></div>
