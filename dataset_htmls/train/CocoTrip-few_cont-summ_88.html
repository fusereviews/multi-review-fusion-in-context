<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Great service, attention to detail</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the ever present taxi-hailer</span> - make it feel like coming home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>Rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>are spacious</span> and comfortable <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>with quiet aircon</span> and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences</span> - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm</span>. This is a word "calm" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool.</span> Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.</div><div class='text-box'>All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>though very expensive,</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to mitigating</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 7'>against the high cost</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had</span> and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap</span> and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>such a wonderful hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must</span>! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>staff members knew our name from the first day</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>In the Lobby all Champagne</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>(Moet Chandon)</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>is free</span>, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi. Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are</span> beautiful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>large</span>, garden and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>pool</span>-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne. Thanks a lot, Achem!</div><div class='text-box'>Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are large</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>standard of cleanlines is very high</span>. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area</span>, however I believe <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the hotel also offer a free shuttle service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>Hotel has a gym and swimming pool</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Buffet breakfast was great</span>, with a huge choice and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>the garden valley wing is an all inclusive</span> break and it's <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>free champagne (Moet)</span> and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are spacious and luxurious</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the staff are very attentive</span>, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.</div><div class='text-box'>Fantastic hotel - wonderful rooms, great beds, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fruit in the room every day</span>, extensive gym.could not have asked for more. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>A few minutes walk from Orchard Road</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>so</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>but far enough away</span> to not hear the noise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>The gym and LINE restaurant were WONDERFUL</span>. I will definitely stay here again - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>perfect for my business trips to Singapore</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>What a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>wonderful atmosphere and a great room</span> for a great price. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The breakfast buffet was out of this world</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The room was gorgeous</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Service was exceptional</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is an ideal stay for those seeking both business and pleasure and with a few extras that aren't typical of most hotels in Singapore.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel isn't exactly central but taxis are pretty cheap and the hotel also provides a shuttle service for free.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">There is a large shopping area within walking distance as well.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms in the hotel were large, spacious and luxurious.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were really clean with quiet air conditioning a pleasant surprise.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel had good attention to detail and the member of staff outside the hotel would always hail the taxi for guests.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is all inclusive and guests receive free champagne in the lobby.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The expense of the rooms if offset by a free afternoon tea, canapes and the provision of drinks.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast buffet is particularly good, with the eggs benedict highly recommended.</span> <span id="9" class="summary-sentence">Brilliant amenities available for guests, including free Wi-Fi, a gym and a swimming pool.</span></div></div>
