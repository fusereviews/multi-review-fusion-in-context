<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at this hotel for 5 day visit to Amsterdam. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The location is very good, being right next to Central Station</span>, but can be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>a little far from some of the tourist spots</span> such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>staff very polite</span>. However, on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the room had not yet been cleaned</span> (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was. The towels that we were promised immediately upon complaining turned up over 2 hours later. At no point were we offered anything to appease us, staff simply apologised and were ineffectual, although polite. This was disappointing, as apart from this, the stay was extremely pleasant.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the mint hotel/ doubletree by hilton. All I can say is that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the rooms were suberb</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Very friendly staff</span> at reception and breakfast was a delight. Unfortunately, room service needs to improve as our expectations were not managed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Food took longer to arrive</span> and had to keep chasing. Also we were told that the kitchen is closed after 45mins of putting our order. However, the rooms and freindliness of the reception/ breakfast team make up for it. Extremely good value for money and will stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Just back from a</span> short <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>trip</span> to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the doubletree for my husbands</span> 30th <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>birthday</span>, what a lovely hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Staff were friendly</span> and helpful and rooms were modern and clean, also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>plenty of choice at breakfast</span> time. We visited the sky lounge on the 11th floor, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it had a nice chilled atmosphere</span> but we only had one drink there as it was VERY expensive! All in all great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>hotel in great location</span>, would not hesitate in staying there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Amsderdam Mint as had previously stayed at the Leeds Mint & enjoyed the experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 7'>The Staff</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>were very helpful & friendly</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>had made a note on booking form was our Wedding Anniversary + my birthday</span> received a bottle of wine in room, also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>complimentary Continental breakfast each day</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Hotel very central</span>, more hotels being built nearby so maybe some disruption? Although we didn`t have any problems.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights for the football at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>Ajax hotel is in a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>great location</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>for the train station and the Metro</span> which you can take direct to the stadium, hotel even sells metro tickets. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>room was great, Apple tv is fantastic</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>bed is the most comfortable</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>i have ever had</span> whilst staying away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>staff all very helpful</span>, will definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>This is an excellent <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel, central for everywhere</span> in Amsterdam <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Rooms are lovely</span>, but even with an upgrade they are still small. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Lovely White Company toiletries</span>. We had a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>lovely view and the balcony is a bonus</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Breakfast is fantastic</span>. You wont need to eat till teatime. Will def re-visit.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in this hotel for a weekend break and was very impressed. The hotel is lovely, very stylish with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>fantastic views</span> (we had a room on the 7th floor). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>The location is ideal - only minutes from town</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Awesome</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2 3'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>next to Central Station</span>? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Must eat at sky lounge</span> at top of hotel.
