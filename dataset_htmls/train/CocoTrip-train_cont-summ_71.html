<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We just had a wonderful Labor day weekend at this hotel with friends and family. We just wanted a small "Mom & Pop" place to enjoy our weekend. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>My girlfried reccommended the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms were exceptionally clean</span>, we had every thing we needed. The staff were all very friendly. It was just the ticket. The atmosphere is so friendly from the staff to the other guests! The pool area was great and the sunrises not to mention the blue moon rises were 'heavenly'. The hotel is so close to many of our favorite resturants and within walking distance from the pier. Its truley located on a beatiful part of the beach. Our family <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>had such a relaxing time</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we can't wait to make plans for a return trip</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I recently stayed at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn and found it to be <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>the</span> most <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>cleanest pet friendly property in Daytona Beach</span>. Other family members of mine also stayed at the inn in different rooms, and loved the fact that the property only had designated rooms in which they allowed pets in. (Some of my family members are allergic to pets : ) ) As far as the staff goes, I found them to be very friendly and very helpful as well. So I would have to say I disagree with the one review which was submitted regarding pet friendly rooms. Because my stay was excellent! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I will definately be going back again next year</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I would like to thank everyone from Housekeeping to Management at Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn for the great vacation I had. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I received a</span> comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span>, and spacious <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room</span>. The bed was comfortable-I heard they added new furniture and mattresses to all of the rooms. The room was smoke-free. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The pool and ocean front area at the Inn was very relaxing as well</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I received a lot of useful information about Daytona Beach activities</span> from the helpful and courteous staff at the Inn. One of the activities the Management recommended was the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse and Inlet. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn is a great place to stay for the whole family and vacationers</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>we have stayed at many hotels/motels in daytona . this year we found THE ATANTIC OCEAN PALM INN. we have already visited there twice the second time with friends and were more than satisfied. the hotel is small around fifty rooms, is family owned and run. the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms are</span> well furnished and along with the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>facilities are</span> very <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>well maintained</span> there is good parking a good pool and of course the hotel is on the beach. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we will be back</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>My friend and I just had a wonderful stay at the Atlantic Palm in at Daytona Beach Shores</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms were very clean</span> and the staff was friendly and accommodating. So were the owners, when you broke a corkskrew they would get you one right away. All the comforts of home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I recommend this hotel highly</span> with reasonable rates and friendly service. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Just a short walk to a heated pool</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the beach</span>. A great place to stay!</div><div class='text-box'>We spent half of our vacation at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn and the other half at an Orlando theme park resort. The overall consensus among our family was that more fun was had at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms were clean</span>, the proximity to the beach was great, the pool was beautiful and the staff members were so nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We will be back next year</span>!</div><div class='text-box'>This was our first trip to Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn and Daytona. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>can't wait to go again</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>we will</span> definitely <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>be staying at the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn</span>. The staff is great and the rooms are very comfortable. It is very convenient to be able to come back from the beach or pool to have a snack or meal in your room.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>If you are looking for a place to stay on the ocean in Daytona Beach look no farther than the Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn</span>.
