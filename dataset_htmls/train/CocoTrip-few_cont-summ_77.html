<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Not a 4-star hotel</span>. We stayed here as part of a group tour through northern Italy. Of the 21 rooms occupied by our group, at least 7 rooms had problems such as foul odors and non-functioning air-conditioning and the occupannts requested a room change. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The first room we were given was tiny the a/c didn't work. The room they gave us next was handicap-accessible and was much larger</span>, with a huge bathroom. The bathroom, however, had no put-down space at all we had to move a small table from the bedroom into it. The neighborhood is very seedy and we were uncomfortable walking around there at night. There are better choices in beautiful Florence.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL This hotel has the most uncaring staff I've ever witnessed</span>. Our hotel room was burglarized while we slept in our beds. No one was injured thankfully, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the hotel displayed a no-care attitude</span>. They never sent a staff person up to the room when we called down to report the intrusion. They made us wait while they checked people in and out before giving us the insurance forms to fill out and made us wait once again while they copied the forms for us. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>They never apologized and basically treated us like we didn't exist</span>. Stay away from this one - there's plenty of hotels in Florence.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 11'>Great</span> little <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 11'>hotel</span> We stayed in a triple room for 4 nights april 10 -14,the hotel was great very clean and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the staff very helpfu</span>,had no problem with the area at all ,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>iit was very convenient as we were traveling by train,just cross the street and you are there</span>,also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the buses on the other side of the station to go to Fiosole,plaza Michelangelo and the discount mall outside of Florence.the</span> breakfast was very good for that size hotel,we did not expect that good selection,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>the restaurant next door for a late dinner</span> or snack <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>is great</span>.I will stay here again and really recommend it</div><div class='text-box'>Well located good hotel We were a little apprehensive booking this hotel because of some negative reviews.

The worst thing is that the construction site started to have someone hammering at 8 or 9am so I had to wake up by 8 or 9 am. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='12'>The sound</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='11 12'>insulation was not good</span>.
