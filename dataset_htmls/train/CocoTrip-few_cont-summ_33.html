<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in central Toronto and settled on 1 king west. My spouse and I stayed in a superior studio suite and were extremely satisfied with our stay. I was attracted initially to the non-cookie cutter rooms typical in most hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room</span> was very modern with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>sophisticated looking furnishings, a very comfortable bed, nice walk-in shower</span> and modern kitchenette. We were stationed on the 18th floor and did find the room a bit dark as our bedroom window was frosted over as it clearly faced another building in close proximity. We did not consider this an issue however because the room had so many other positives and the 'office' section of the room offered a view of the lake. My only disappointment was that there was no wi-fi (only hard-wired) so I was unable to use it.</div><div class='text-box'>This hotel was spacious, quiet and very clean. I would sum up the negative points of some other reviews by saying that this property is new and they are clearly still working on "opening" and getting their procedures in place. We had a glitch with our cards upon check-in and the staff upgraded us to a deluxe 2-room suite on the 44th floor with views on 3 sides. We moved to this hotel after having a bad experience at the Cosmpolitan, which is right across the street. We did not have any problems or costs involved with getting our car in and out, and another cool benefit is that the concierge staff has a fleet of vintage cars (Bentley, '60 Cadillac, Rolls) with drivers who will take you to various downtown sites for free (with an advance reservation).</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I've stayed at this hotel several times</span> on trips to Toronto. It is in a great location. Walking distance to Eaton Centre, restaurants and theatres. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Parking price is a little steep at 30$ a day but will pay around that amount anywhere</span> in T.O. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room came well equiped - washer, dryer, kitchenette and king bed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Only negative in the room was the shower which tended to leak all over the bathroom floor</span> and was so powerful it was an extremely uncomfortable experience. This could be room-specific as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I did not have this experience on my previous stays</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Overall, for the price, this is a great place to stay</span> in downtown T.O.</div><div class='text-box'>Fabulous few days in Toronto! Hotel is in a fab location to walk to the main shopping mall and the heart of Downtown. Hotel is very clean and the staff were lovely, very helpful and pleasant . <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms were very clean</span> and comfortable, and just right for a short city break, as we didn't spend much time in the room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The parking in the hotel was very very expensive $30 per night</span>! We had a car for 4 nights so worked out very expensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Lovely</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>breakfast</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>though but</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>again a little overpriced</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I'd read the reviews and felt confident we'd get value.and we did. A nice clean hotel in a great location for site seeing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short break to take in Torontos sites. Very good. My only small gripe is I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>would have liked bottled water available in the room</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'> You need to buy your own</span> but that's a minor personal irritation. Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>everything seemed first rate</span> .until i had to deal with the concierge.i think her name was christine. maybe she should work by herself.she seemed upset when my family requested reservations were asked to be made. but the rest of the property was outstanding. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>will stay again.just</span> wouldnt use the conceirge again.</div><div class='text-box'>This was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>our third time staying at this hotel</span>. What brings us back? Cleanliness, location (max 10 minute walk to Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Union Station, Historic District), friendliness, quality of room, and price. Also, the concierge is really helpful.</div><div class='text-box'>Great Hotel. I stayed for 3nights in early July with my husband and 2 teenage sons sharing 1 <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>room. Plenty of space, 2 TVs</span>, Very clean. Nice bar area. Frendly staff and good position. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>For the money it is hard to fault it</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel has served guests who have stayed on repeated occasions.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The room is very well-equipped and clean too, but the shower did often leak onto the bathroom floor.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast in the hotel was a little expensive and there was no bottled water available in the room.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The parking provided at the hotel is really expensive but in other aspects the hotel did provide good value.</span></div></div>
