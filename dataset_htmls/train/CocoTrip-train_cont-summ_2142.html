<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Shangri-La, Sydney in July, 2011. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We received first-class service from the moment we arrived</span> until we arrived at the airport on the day we were leaving. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We had a corner room on the 27th floor, with a 260 degree view</span>. We could see all the way <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>from the Bridge</span> down through the harbour, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>past the Opera House</span> to the heads. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We enjoyed every minute of our stay, including the food and service</span> at both the restaurants . and even room service was special. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The room itself was</span> newly renovated so everything was <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>clean and fresh</span>. We did not lack for anything. The concierge was able to answer all of our questions and help us out when we needed it. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>It was a fabulous finale for the end of our Australian vacation</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>We have stayed in a few 4 and 5 star hotels</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and this one is definitely one of the best</span>. We received a free room upgrade to get <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a view of Opera House and Harbour Bridge</span> from the tenth floor. The bed was enormous, and very comfortable; and the bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom! I had a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>massage</span> at the spa while we were there, which <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is one of the best I'd ever had</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The staff were excellent; friendly and helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>We had</span> valet parking and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast included in our room cost</span> (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>good value, considering</span>); and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel is well located in the Rocks area, with an easy walk to just about anywhere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Great place, we would definitely stay there again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent some time in The Shangri La hotel as part of our honeymoon in Jan 2008 and were not disappointed. We had a deluxe harbour view room and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the views of the Opera House were amazing</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Our room was</span> very modern and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>exceptionally clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Reception and concierge staff were friendly</span> and attentive. Buffet <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>breakfast was very nice but expensive if not included in your package</span>. The location was excellent and one 2min walk to the Rocks and 5min walk to Circular Quay, note the walk to and from the hotel is on very, very steep hills. My only complaint would be the Spa, the treatments were expensive and the reception staff of the spa, I found very unhelpful. The hotel is very expensive but as a treat, worth it!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>This was definatley the best hotel I have stayed in</span>! My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night as a treat and we were not disappointed. We were upgraded from a standard room to the Grand Appartment which turned out to be suite with a huge lounge, kitchen, dining room, and of course bedroom. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room had 270 degree views</span> of Sydney Harbour <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>which were breathtaking</span>! If you stay at this hotel, be sure to have a drink at the Blu Horizon bar at the top of the hotel which again had amazing views of the harbour. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The service was great</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>as soon as we set foot in the hotel and nothing was too much trouble</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>My boyfriend and I stayed for one night in October during our trip around Australia. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>I found the people on reception to be rude</span> and far from welcoming however. We stayed in an Opera View Room and we were not disappointed, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the view</span> and the decor <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was perfect</span> and it was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in, we even wrote down the name of the mattress! We had dinner in our room as it was a romantic night away and we didn't want to see anybody else. The food was fantastic. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Overall we had a very pleasant stay</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>if we</span> are ever lucky enough to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>go back to Sydney we would both stay here</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Shangri La for six nights. We were upgraded to a Grand Harbour View room and couldn't have been more delighted. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The view was fantastic</span>. Our daughter (who we were visiting in Sydney) had never seen such a good view and she had been in the City for seven months. We had a lovely time and could'nt fault the hotel. We used the services of <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the concierge</span> on a couple of occasions and he <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was excellent</span>. Overall, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>a fabulous stay</span> and if we ever visit Sydney again, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>we would not hesitate to stay here</span>. We were sorry to leave.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed three nights at this nice, modern hotel in the Rocks. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We were pleased with the size of the room and the great view of the Sydney Opera House</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>This is the second time we have stayed at a Shangri La property</span> (Bangkok was the first) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>and once again the service was very good</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Nice, welcoming people</span> both <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>at check in</span> and at the concierge. Free access to the internet and plenty of computers available. Sydney is an expensive city but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>this hotel is a decent value</span>. The inside pool is not bad either.</div><div class='text-box'>When we arrived at the hotel we were delighted to be given an upgrade at no extra charge. Our room was on the 16th floor and we had the most <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fabulous view of</span> both <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Opera House</span> and the Bridge. Our room was very spacious, very comfortable and had everything you could wish for. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Breakfasts were good</span> with a lovely selection and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>staff friendly</span> and helpful. We had a wonderful stay and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>hope to come back again</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Only good thing about the stay was the view we had of the opera house and bridge.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">Although the room was clean, we asked for non smoking room, room we were given had previously been used by smokers and stank every time we walked in, the front of the safe was hanging off when we arrived, as was the internet box on the skirting.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The reception staff were very rude when we checked in, the most friendly and polite people in the hotel were the porters, we had complimentary breakfast included which was just as well as food is expensive in this hotel.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">I have stayed in other Shangri La hotels and this one did not compare at all well, will not be staying here again.</span></div></div>
