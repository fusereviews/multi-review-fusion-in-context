<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I did a tour with Tour East which included High Tea at Raffles Hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I had been told it was great but had to do it to find out how good! I would recomend it to any one that asks</span>! I also did the Tour East Tour that included a Singapore Sling at Raffles, I opted out of the Singapore Sling for $29.50,Thought it was over priced. I can understand some one who says having the Singapore Sling as a memorable experience, to note as having done it. Tick it off as been there done that. I can say the same as having just experiencing the aura of The Long Bar and treading on peanut shells as an experience in itself. Can recomend to anyone thinking of doing these tours or others with Tour East. Very professional group Thank you for a wonderful holiday.</div><div class='text-box'>This one is easy. Go there, try to make it to a table without slipping on the (signature) peanut shells on the floor. A Singapore sling (comes in several flavours) is 26 SGD plus 17 percent. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>place is normally crowded</span>, yes <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>there is even a queue at the door at times</span>. The place is full of tourists, Americans are there in large numbers. The toilets around the corner are totally out of character with the Raffles hotel in particular and Singapore standards in general. Hence try to avoid them. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is very neat</span>, the beautiful reception is closed to non-guests and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the restaurants of top class</span>. The Long bar is there for tourists and the profit only. It could as well be closed as it no longer has anything to do with the hotel as such.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Very disappointed with the afternoon tea</span> in the Tiffin Room. The sandwiches had been made for hours and the bread was very dry. Not much selection of other food. Must say <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the service was excellent</span> and all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>staff at the hotel were pleasant</span>. We stayed at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and are sorry now that we did not partake of their aftenoon tea service, but Raffles being Raffles, we thought it was going to be "the tops".</div><div class='text-box'>Whats not to like about the Raffles Hotel Singapore? The staff is almost perfect in their service and attentiveness. The rooms are exquisite. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is gorgeous</span> and a nice oasis in the midst of an urban landscape. Its a beautiful place with an appropriately <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>high-class staff that gives</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>excellent recommendations</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>for restaurants</span>, tourist information, and navigating the city. We think everyone deserves to stay here at least once in his or her lifetime.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Bed was super comfy</span>, c, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>water power is strong</span> - something which I miss in some hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Room was also equipped with DVD player - it was useful one afternoon when it rained</span> so hard so we spent the time watching films. Other than that, the rest of our stay was wonderful and we'd surely come .</div><div class='text-box'>The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Spa is out of this world</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Expensive</span> but fabulous. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>Restaurants are great</span>. Overall I would say this is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>probably the best hotel</span> we have ever stayed.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Bit pricey</span> but loved it, rooms amazing so <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>many service buttons</span> didnt know which to press would stay again in a flash on any special occasion</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The hotel</span> is well located, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Very beautiful rooms</span>, good breakfast & location. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Although expensive, this hotel is worth every penny with the beautiful decor and top-class restaurant.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is a very popular hotel with crowds and queuing at the door.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The room had a very comfortable bed, great water pressure in the shower and even a DVD player for those rainy days.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The service provided was of a very high quality, and the staff at this hotel were very pleasant to be around.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The restaurants are mostly great but the afternoon tea will leave a lot to be desired.</span></div></div>
