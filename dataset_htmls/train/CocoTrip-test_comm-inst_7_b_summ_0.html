<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at parrot key before and was very impressed, so i booked agian, for fantasy fest, we stayed a total of three nights, I will say the location is not in the heart of downtown but that was one of my favorite things about the hotel, a short taxi ride away from the choas of downtown was our quite, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>spacious room</span>. Where we could catch some well needed sleep. Last time we stayed we stayed we were so impressed with the quilty bedding we spent the next day shopping for new sheets for our house, sleeping at parrot key is like sleeping on a cloud, I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>can't say enough about this place</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff is top- notch</span>,</div><div class='text-box'>From the very first time I stayed there on a short pleasure weekend I feel in love with the resort. I was looking to get away to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a tropical place not far from</span> my home in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Fort Lauderdale</span> and I found it. Relaxing in the pool, working out or sipping cocktails in one of the three great salt pools took me where I wanted to go to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>peace and tranquility</span> yet only three hours from home. I have been back now two more times and it's becoming my home away from home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I hghly recommend the resort</span> and all of the staff memebers Sean was the best ask for him when making your reservation. go and enjoy stop reading now. trust me!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I stayed at Parrot Key</span> once before when it first opened <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and loved it</span>, so I chose this property again when I needed a room in Key West for Fantasy Fest. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The grounds look even more lush and beautiful than before</span>. From the road it's hard to tell what paradise awaits you as you step into the property. My sister and I had a two-level suite that was fantastic. The front desk gave us all the inforamtion we needed on the events and how to get to and from Duval during this busy time. We absolutely loved it and will stay at Parrot Key again next year!</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed two nights in June. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The resort was excellent! Staff and service was impeccable</span>. The resort is the right mix of relaxation. We spent most of our days relaxing in the 4 beautiful pools and sitting by the outdoor bar. It is a bit of a drive away from duval street but we weren't too keen on the drunks and parties that you find there so we were quite happy to relax at the resort. We were upgraded to a two bedroom cottage and it was spectacular! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would definitely go back</span> to the parrot key resort again!</div><div class='text-box'>We had the 3 bedroom ocean view cottage. Due to the lush foliage, the ocean is only visible from the decks off the upper rooms. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>rooms are spacious</span> and well furnished. The only thing lacking is a washer/dryer and you could live there. The only reason I would not go back is the price - including the resort fee, the lowest rate available in February was just under $600 per night when booked months in advance. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>enjoyed our stay</span>, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>will try to find something less expensive next time</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>From the moment we checked in we were greeted by <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very friendly and helpful staff</span>. Oriana, Rutanya, and Shenali (sp) overextended themselves and made us feel more than welcome, like we were at home. We are down for a birthday and the staff was helpful enough to recommend a bakery for a cake and set up the room fit for royalty. The atmosphere is beyond anything we expected. The property is lush and exotic. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms are very clean</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We will definitely be back</span> =)</div><div class='text-box'>We loved Parrot Key. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The rooms</span> and grounds <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>were absolutely beautiful</span>. We especially loved the little porches. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>Everything was very clean</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly</span>. We also enjoyed the onsite jet ski tour! The only down side of Parrot Key is that the cab ride to Duval street/ mallory square was about $15 each way which got pretty expensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We would defiantly stay at Parrot Key again</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great staff, wonderful grounds, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>pools are amazing</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would def go back</span>! Trying to plan another trip for January!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel is really enjoyable and definitely recommended.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The rooms of the hotel are clean and spacious.</span></div></div>
