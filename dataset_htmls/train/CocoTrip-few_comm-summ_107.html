<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I traveled here for business for the first time and was somewhat disappointed. There is only wireless internet service in most of the rooms, which I can not use with my office laptop for security reasons. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>had to switch rooms</span> in order to have high speed internet access. and the internet service seemed to work only some of the time. The connection wasn't working consistently and nobody in the hotel could help. They offered a toll free number for the tech people at the DSL company. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>front desk failed to provide me with my mini-bar key</span> and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack in it. There were many many tourists in the hotel, which isn't good for business travelers because they tend to make a lot of noise. I don't think I'll travel here again unless I am a tourist.</div><div class='text-box'>I stay at this hotel very frequently, and every single time, my experience has been fabulous. The hotel is right in the downtown area and 5 min. walk from South Station which really helps me as I frequently take the train from/to New York. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The rooms are</span> really nice, bathrooms and linen really <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> and above all else, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the staff is some of the most friendly I have ever come across</span>, rifht from the front desk to the concierge and housekeeping. Samir Boukhari, the front desk manager is delightfully courteous and has always gone out of his way to help and make my stay very comfortable every single time. Dianna, Aruna and Lexi at the front desk and Anthony with the concierge are wonderful as ever. I would stay here as long as business/pleasure keeps taking me into Boston.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed here for business. It was in a great location, close to the theater district, shopping, etc. There is only one restaurant and a very small bar in the hotel. It would have been nice to have additional options. There were restaurants close by, but again, it would have been nice to have had the convenience of additional dining places. The fitness center was so so. I was very disappointed that there was a charge for internet. When paying the price we paid per night, that should have been included in the room cost. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great concierges</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Boston for one night during Memorial Day weekend. The staff was great, we were upgraded to a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Terrace Suite</span> when we checked in. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>was</span> beautiful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very clean</span>/pleasant, although you can't actually go out onto the Terrace so that was bittersweet. We ordered <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room service which was excellent</span>! The breakfast buffet was wonderful as well! Great location to all of Boston. Overall a great trip! Will return to this hotel whenever we are in Boston.</div><div class='text-box'>When we booked this hotel we were worried because we saw more negative reviews than good at that time. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I have no complainst.the staff was very helpful</span>, the in house restaurant was excellent, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the rooms were very clean</span>. Very close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and Marshall's. . .walking distance to all other sites that we wanted to see. . . The only thing I can say negatively is paying for WIFI but that is a problem with all hotels.</div><div class='text-box'>hi, i have read all the reviews and they are a bit mixed.We have just stayed there n i have to say it 's great.Its a central location - we hired a car and left it back 4 days early as parking is so expensive-unless u have to dont hire a car-otherwise park it in the place out in front of the hotel its the cheapest we checked them all i have the sore feet to prove it!</div><div class='text-box'>Disappointing when hotels such as this still charge for wifi access. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We didn't get notified verbally about the complimentary breakfast</span> either although it was no doubt in the fine print somewhere. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Rooms were</span> nice and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean</span> although a little boring and the bed not that comfortable. Can't fault the location, it was very easy to get anywhere with the subway station a few hundred metres away.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location and greater service at this Hyatt in Boston. No more convient place to stay. Came in by train and never needed to have a car. You are right in the middle of everything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel & service is top notch</span> and this isn't my first stay in Boston!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were very clean and the service excellent.</span></div></div>
