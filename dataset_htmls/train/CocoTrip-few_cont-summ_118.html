<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We were originally due to stay for 10 nights and we booked for three people - my teenager daughter and her friend and myself. On arrival in the room the beds were very small double beds and only two of them - I spoke to the manager who said that all the rooms were exactly the same (untrue) and that for an extra $10 we could have a rollaway bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms are far too small for more than two people</span>. The site is not well maintained and the pool not clean. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We</span> were then stranded due to the volcano and having <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>enquired about staying for an additional five nights was told that we could have a special price of $39 per night - only to find out on the website for the hotel that the cost for that period of time would be $32 per night. Scammed! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>there are far better places to stay which are closer to the amenities</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This is the second time <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>we have stayed at this hotel</span> and both times have been totally <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>trouble free</span>. We stayed for 10 nights and had no problems. The room was clean and was cleaned every day, towels and bed sheets changed we came back every day to a spotless room. We only seen reception staff to check in and out but they seemed friendly enough and there were no additional charges over what we paid when we booked. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The location is exellent</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>took about 10 mins to get to disney and about 20 mins to Universal and Seaworld</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Aircon and tv worked well</span> and there was always a parking space outside our room despite the hotel being quite busy over spring break. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I will definatly stay here again</span> if back in Orlando :)</div><div class='text-box'>The "Hotel" is actually like something straight out of My Name is Earl. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Filthy carpets</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>bugs in the refridgerator and all over the room</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Horrendously misrepresented by the pictures on the website</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the bbq area and lagoon are disgraceful</span>. I paid for 2 star Quality, but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would never stay here, recommend it, etc</span>. In fairness the staff are very friendly and all issues raised were dealt with, they seem to know with the quality of their resort, they HAVE to provide good service. Bar is very reasonable, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Long Island Iced tea recommended</span>.

The shuttle was not so confy, because run for 3 hotels, but Champions is the first so you can have a seat haha. If you have a car, fine, because if you don't have a car you don't have many alternatives to eat. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I like this hotel and really recomend it</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>This hotel is near to a Chinese buffett, Dominos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Walgreens, McDonalds</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This is one of my favorite hotels in Kissimmee. It is a Instead super comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>accessible parks and disney all the best places you can eat</span> in your vacation. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>attention is very satisfactory</span>. I have two Sometimes visiting this hotel and will not be the last. since its price and the comfort of your rooms make your stay a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very welcoming</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I had a lovey stay. The resort is a value, and taking the back road on Sherberth, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>I traveled to Disney in 6 minutes</span>. The staff is warm and attentive. I felt like I was at home with family.</div><div class='text-box'>Champions World Resort was exactly what we were looking for. A brief relaxing weekend near Orlando Fl. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooms were nice and clean</span>, and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>hotel staff was very responsive and attentive to our needs</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I highly recommend this resort</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We stay here every year. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>I like the hotel, its clean</span>, the employees are very nice and the prices are great.
