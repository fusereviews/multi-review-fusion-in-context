<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We chose the Hilton Bonaventure for our recent stay in Montreal based on the glowing recommendation of a frequent flying family member. The downtown location proved to be a great starting point for our city explorations. The room was clean, well laid out, and comfortable. The staff was courteous and al spoke flawless English. One evening we decided to sample some local ice wine we had purchased, the hotel quickly brought us glasses, opened, and then served us our wine. The breakfast was delicious, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the selection at the bar was above average</span>. The rooftop garden was beautiful, although we didnat have time to walk though it in its entirety. Over all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I give this hotel my full recommendation</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hilton Bonaventure definitely provides bang for your buck</span>. The layout for this hotel is very unique. It has many "wings" and each wing has access to its own private pool. It also has many water features and excellent landscaping throughout the outdoor patios that are accessible privately via the rooms. You don't even realize that you are on the 17th floor once you get off the main elevator at the reception level and the view of the city from that floor is breathtaking. The staff is quite friendly and accomodating. The only drawback: <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>wired interenet only available for 1 computer in each room</span>. Wireless internet is only available in the lobby. However, I enjoyed my stay!</div><div class='text-box'>Recently in Montreal to attend a concert with my teen Grand daughter and her friend. We chose the Bonaventure after much consideration due to it's proximity to the bell Centre( concert Venue and also Hockey Game Venue which my husband was attending). <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The decision could not have been better</span>.The Bonaventure is connected to Montreal's extensive underground City, lots of shopping, a skating rink, movie theatres.we were thrilled. To say nothing of the friendly hotel staff.to a person they were helpful and welcoming. This is obviously a very well run facility. The management and staff should be proud.</div><div class='text-box'>There are no elevators and the staff doesn't tell you. I had to drag my bags upstairs and then downstairs. There were no bellmans available when we arrived. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was horrible for $100US per night. When I asked for a closer room, I was given a downgraded room. I've never stayed at a 4 star hotel without elevators and no bellmen</span>. Also, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the drain in the bathtub was very slow</span>. You end up showering in 4 inches of water.</div><div class='text-box'>hotel in central downtown location. Comfortable, the greatest asset is the garden with swimming pool on the top floor is even heated in winter ! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Book a room on the executive floor and enjoy complimentary breakfast and evening appetizers and snacks for a small fee</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A perfect hotel to stay in the city</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wonderful quality hotel</span>. The garden and pool are a great escape from the city below. The room was clean, comfortable and tastefully renovated - very modern yet so comfy. The staff was very helpful and the location of the hotel is perfect for every sight in Montreal.</div><div class='text-box'>Was participating at a business convention in Montreal. We stayed at this hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Nice hotel with comfortable beds and nice view</span> of downtown Montreal. Near Place Bonaventure. Closed to Bell centre and all fancy restaurant around.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything about this hotel was fine</span>. It is a typical, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>better-than-averagely run downtown Hilton property</span>. I went there for a few days on business and ended up liking it a lot.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">A good quality hotel that provides a nice and enjoyable stay that will not break the bank.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The bathtub in the room took too long to drain and there is only the facility for one computer to have access to the internet per room.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel's breakfast selection was really good, as well as the selection provided at the bar.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">Rooms on the executive floor are provided with a complimentary breakfast, as well as appetisers and snacks for a nominal fee.</span></div></div>
