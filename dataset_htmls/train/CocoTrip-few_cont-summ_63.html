<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>this hotel</span> for 5 day visit to Amsterdam. The location is very good, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>being right next to Central Station</span>, but can be a little far from some of the tourist spots such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and staff very polite. However, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>The towels that we were promised immediately upon complaining turned up over 2 hours later</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>At no point were we offered anything to appease us, staff simply apologised and were ineffectual, although polite. This was disappointing</span>, as apart from this, the stay was extremely pleasant.</div><div class='text-box'>We spent 2 nights at the mint hotel/ doubletree by hilton. All I can say is that the rooms were suberb. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Very friendly staff</span> at reception and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>breakfast was a delight</span>. Unfortunately, room service needs to improve as <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>our expectations were not managed</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Food took longer to arrive</span> and had to keep chasing. Also we were told that the kitchen is closed after 45mins of putting our order. However, the rooms and freindliness of the reception/ breakfast team make up for it. Extremely good value for money and will stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>Just back from a short trip to the doubletree for my husbands 30th birthday, what a lovely hotel. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Staff were friendly and helpful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>rooms were modern</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>clean</span>, also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>plenty of choice at breakfast time</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>We visited the sky lounge on the 11th floor, it had a nice chilled atmosphere but we only had one drink there as it was VERY expensive</span>! All in all great hotel in great location, would not hesitate in staying there again.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Amsderdam Mint as had previously stayed at the Leeds Mint & enjoyed the experience. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The Staff were very helpful & friendly</span>, had made a note on booking form was our Wedding Anniversary + my birthday received a bottle of wine in room, also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>complimentary Continental breakfast each day</span>. Hotel very central, more hotels being built nearby so maybe some disruption? Although we didn`t have any problems.</div><div class='text-box'>Stayed for 3 nights for the football at <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Ajax hotel is in a great location for the train station and the Metro</span> which you can take direct to the stadium, hotel even sells metro tickets. room was great, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Apple tv is fantastic</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bed is the most comfortable i have ever had</span> whilst staying away. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>staff all very helpful</span>, will definitely stay there again.</div><div class='text-box'>This is an excellent hotel, central for everywhere in Amsterdam Rooms are lovely, but even with an upgrade they are still small. Lovely White Company toiletries. We had <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>a lovely view and the balcony</span> is a bonus. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast is fantastic</span>. You wont need to eat till teatime. Will def re-visit.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed in this hotel for a weekend break and was very impressed. The hotel is lovely, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>very stylish with</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 2'>fantastic views</span> (we had a room on the 7th floor). The location is ideal - only minutes from town.</div><div class='text-box'>Awesome <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>hotel next to Central Station</span>? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 6'>Must eat at sky lounge</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>at top of hotel. It over looks the entire city</span>. Perfect location to all tourist attractions.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is close to the Metro and train stations, with a great view from the balcony.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is also right next to Central Station.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Despite some issues with the room not being cleaned despite asking repeatedly for it to be, the rooms are stylish and give you great views.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The bed is incredibly comfortable and the room even has Apple TV in it.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very polite and apologetic for any problems although no compensation was offered.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast provided by the hotel was really good, although took a little longer than expected sometimes.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The sky lounge of the hotel is recommended but can be expensive.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The towels provided by the hotel turned up later than requested.</span></div></div>
