<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>Overpriced Stayed there with my family Aug 1 to 4 2005. Good points - its on Bourbon Street. Bad points - its on Bourbon Street + everything else. Asked for a quiet room months ahead, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>we were given a room next to the elevator:</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>noisy</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'> lots of convention goers yelling up and down the corridor at 3 a.m.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Parking is difficult - they have a garage (about $30/ day !) but its small and spaces are tight</span>. My wife had to go to ER whilst we were there, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>they didn't even know where the nearest hospital was</span> ! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Constant feeling that they wanted our cash but didn't want to provide anything like service in return</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Avoid</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Had a great time</span>! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>We splurged and booked two Bourbon Street balcony rooms</span> for a post-graduation celebration with our two young adult daughters. Although the hotel itself is a little long-in-the-tooth, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>its location on lower Bourbon Street can't be beat</span>.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'></span> There are nicer, fancier hotels and inns nearby, but we chose the Royal Sonesta specifically for its location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Yes, it's noisy and you can hear music and rowdy crowds until late at night, but we anticipated this too</span>. Bourbon Street was busier for an early June Monday and Tuesday night than I would have expected, but we had fun sitting on the balcony, throwing beads at the crowds who happened to walk by.</div><div class='text-box'>Jazzfest <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Stay here for 8 nights</span> and for the most part <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it was very enjoyable</span> except for a few monir things that added up. For about 3-4 days <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>the hot water was only luke warm</span>, one day I went out and took off the privacy sign and by 3pm the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>room was not made up</span>, had to call housekeeping and when I returned at 4pm, it still was not done, had to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>put in an angry second call</span> to have the room done ASAP. Also one monring I had the privacy sign on and housekeeping still knocked on my door, lucky I was not sleeping.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The location cannot be beat</span> and service/<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>staff is still very good</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Great hotel! I have family in New Orleans so I am pretty familiar with the city.I have stayed in a good deal of places/areas of town. The Royal Sonesta, by far, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>offers the best location</span> and experience. One of the three hotel bars to the GREAT restaurant for breakfast to the fabulous rooms, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>this place is a treasure</span>. We had a courtyard room that opened up to the pool deck. BEAUTIFUL! And the price was right too!</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>No one returns emails or calls</span>.Upcoming Stay I have booked a room for an upcoming Conference-American College of Cardiology; I have sent emails to various managers at hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>inquiring what amenities are included for the room price of $300+/</span> SHOCKER - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>No one responds</span>. I haven't even arrived there for my MARCH Conference, and I am feeling like <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>this is a poorly managed hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Great place on Bourbon Street</span> Stayed one night at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon Street. What a great place, very classy and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>you can't beat the location</span>. Went in June so the rates were very inexpensive. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4 5'>Rooms were very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>quiet</span>. Definitely would stay there again. First Class.</div><div class='text-box'>Great location, tiny rooms <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Nice hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>in a great location</span>, but very overpriced. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>The room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>was small</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>not very well maintained</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Parking was also overpriced</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>scratched my spouse's custom car when the valet parked it.</span></div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Very nice hotel</span> Very nice hotel. The reception area is extremely nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms</span> are also very nice with large flat screens although they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>are quite small</span>.Very good breakfast. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Very good location</span> though as a result <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>quite noisy</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">Splurge a little to get the Bourbon Street balcony room, it's worth it.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It's noisy with crowds and music but that's expected.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">This is a great place to stay.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The location of the hotel is unbeatable.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms at this hotel were small and at times noisy.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">Housekeeping did not clean it until prompted by an angry call.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">Bad quality service provided at this hotel, and the staff seem to be unaware of the location of amenities such as the closest hospital.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">Parking at this hotel is both difficult and overpriced for the size of what is more so a garage.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">There also seems to be an issue with the hot water at times.</span></div></div>
