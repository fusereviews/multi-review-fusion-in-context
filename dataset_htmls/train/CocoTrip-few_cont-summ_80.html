<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Cheapest decent hotel</span> in Chicago <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>that I could find</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Nice large room which was pretty modern looking considering the age of the building</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Appreciated the free WiFi and the fact that you have to swipe your key to get on the elevator or stairs- extra security</span> (though somehow the pizza delivery guy was able to get up to our room, must have an agreement with the hotel.) Street noise didn't bother me too much. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>Breakfast was great</span>, although <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the room was a little cramped</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The only complaint I have is that its hard to pull up to the front of the hotel to get valet parking</span> ($22/24 hours) Great hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>I stayed here by myself the night before a group tour and got a single room, which came with a double bed. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>The sheets are soft and there four pillows on the bed</span>! Awesome. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The room is perfect</span> for one or two people. The area is great, although not serviceable by the train, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>it has buses to the city</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The area itself is really upbeat, with a young crowd</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Great</span> little shops, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>restaurants and bars</span>. I'd stay here again for sure if I were in Chicago. It<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>'s a nice alternative to the large downtown hotels</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>This was my first trip to Chicago and Days Inn made it even better! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It is a</span> great <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>bargain</span> especially for the location. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel was clean</span>, the staff was so darn nice, the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>free bfast was</span> mmm soo <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>good-</span> the muffins were amazing, fresh squeezed juice, and even make your own waffles. The only complaint is the drain in the shower wasn't working as smoothly as it should have been. I can't see how anything could go wrong here and even if it did, front desk was just so ncie!</div><div class='text-box'>The staff at this hotel were extremely gracious and went out of their way to welcome me. I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>arrived early and</span> the staff <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>had a room cleaned</span> and ready for me promptly. Property is located right in the heart of Lincoln Park and there are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>numerous dining and nightlife options</span> at the property doorstep. I will definitely return to this property. The Days Inn brand gets a serious upgrade in my mind with properties of this character.</div><div class='text-box'>Travelled with a friend for a quick getaway. We were in a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>room with</span> 2 beds, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>fridge</span>, & <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>micro(we</span> were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>in room</span> 403), room with views of Clark St. As always it was a great stay, staff very friendly, and willing to help in any way possible. If your not a continental b-fast kind-of-person, I would suggest The Golden Nugget one block south of Diversey on Clark.</div><div class='text-box'>This old Days Inn is in the heart of Lincoln Park and a short walk to Boys Town.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel was clean</span> and the free <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>breakfeast was a big hit</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>My only complait are the bathrooms</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Time to upgrade</span>! They all have this 3 inch step up which is just great to trip over at 3 am in the dark. Other then that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>this is a nice hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 15 years. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 4'>It is</span> quiet, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>moderately priced</span>, and very conveniently <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>located near several bus lines</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Clark Street, on which it is located, is a major shopping street</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>there is parking at the nearby Century Mall</span>. I have found the staff to be friendly and helpful.</div><div class='text-box'>We booked this hotel for a girl's trip to Chicago. I booked solely on written reviews.and boy were we impressed! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>For the price, this hotel is PERFECT</span>! The beds were great, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 4'>rooms were very clean</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>breakfast was the best.waffles.YUMMY.and</span> the staff was so helpful and friendly! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Great location to public transportation</span>. Highly recommend this property!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is generally a nice hotel for the price.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">It is clean and in an upbeat area popular with the younger crowd.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is located on a major shopping street, Clark Street and Century Mall is nearby which offers parking.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">There are also bus lines close by and many restaurants and bars to choose from.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms were always very clean even if you turn up slightly early.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The sheers are lovely and soft and there are plenty of pillows.</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">The room actually had a fridge and micro which is great because the building seems old but rooms are so modern.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel offers a great breakfast.</span> <span id="8" class="summary-sentence">This hotel offers free WiFi and additional security to get into the hotel but it can be difficult to park at the front for valet parking.</span></div></div>
