<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>As a regular business traveller</span> to Singapore <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>Great service</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'> attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer</span> - make it feel like coming home. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Rooms are spacious and comfortable</span> with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Room service is of a good standard</span> and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.</div><div class='text-box'>You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best</span>, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word "calm" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='9'>cold water and iced face towels</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8 9'>around the pool</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Service cannot be faulted</span> and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.</div><div class='text-box'>All the good points have been made in previous reviews but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here</span>. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best</span> I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a wonderful hotel</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the absolute friendly and warm staff members</span> knew our name from the first day. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Service is Top-end, nothing to do better</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>Rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>beautiful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>large</span>, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool</span> with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne. Thanks a lot, Achem!</div><div class='text-box'>Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Excellant service and staff</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>Rooms are large</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>standard of cleanlines is very high</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>Wifi access free throughout the</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 8'>hotel</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>with great connectivity</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area</span>, however I believe the hotel also <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>offer a free shuttle service</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8 9'>Hotel has a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>gym and swimming</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8 9'>pool</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>Buffet breakfast was great</span>, with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>a huge choice</span> and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>cannot praise it highly enough</span>, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>The rooms are</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>spacious</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>luxurious</span> and the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4 5'>staff are very attentive</span>, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Fantastic hotel</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>wonderful rooms</span>, great beds, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>fruit in the room every day</span>, extensive <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>gym.could not have asked for more</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>A few minutes walk from Orchard Road so when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close</span> but far enough away to not hear the noise. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>The gym</span> and LINE restaurant <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='8'>were WONDERFUL</span>. I will definitely stay here again - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>perfect for my business trips</span> to Singapore.</div><div class='text-box'>What a wonderful atmosphere and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>a great room for a great price</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='6'>The breakfast buffet was out of this world</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The room was gorgeous</span>.
