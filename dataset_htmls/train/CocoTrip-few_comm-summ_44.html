<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed here during Mardi Gras and could<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nt ask for a better location</span>. St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room</span> is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>equipped with a small kitchen</span> which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, it's a good base to explore New Orleans with the trolley right outside your door. It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter.probably 30 minutes to 40 minutes. The rooms could be updated, but the staff was very helpful even during the stressful Mardi Gras time (super busy for them) It also had a very spacious and updated gym to burn those calories off from all the good food you eat in New Orleans</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>From the time we stepped out of our car</span> to hand over our keys <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>to the time we left we were treated like royalty</span>. The porters, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and made us feel most welcome</span> especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in a studio with a king bed and full kitchen, dressing area and shower. All were very clean. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise. The Resort is in a residential area right on the St. Charles trolley line. We purchased a Jazzy Pass at Walgreens down the street and never needed our car.</div><div class='text-box'>My daughter and I spend a weekend here while job hunting, school interviewing and house hunting. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This was the perfect home base for all of our explorations</span>. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying outside of the Quarter. It was wonderful! The staff was amazing, so very nice. The rooms were spacious and well appointed, the beds very comfortable and everything upgraded and modern. Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy. Would recommend this to anyone visiting this amazing city!</div><div class='text-box'>WOW - looking via the internet I was looking forward to staying at the Avenue Plaza. Too bad there was no information about them being timeshares. The location is great - right on the St. Charles streetcar line. But we didn't get fresh towels, the beds were not made up, the floors were dirty.NOT what you want to see when you are traveling, especially when you know there are <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>so many hotels</span> in NO <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>that are way classier</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Would not recommend staying</span> here at all.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great hotel</span>. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. The staff was very nice. The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot. The bathroom was small, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great location</span> for bar/ restaurant hopping on St Charles, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>nice and clean pool</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>fantastic steak house on site</span>! Fun 24/7 bar next door for karaoke. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Loved my stay</span> for my birthday. Walk down to the Blind Pelican for drinks, 15$ taxi to quarter, great shopping on Magazine st.</div><div class='text-box'>Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were large and clean and well appointed with tv, kitchenette, etc. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Great shower</span>. Even though this is a timeshare there was no pressure to buy. All staff went out of there way to be helpful.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This is a wonderful place to stay</span> in a beautiful section of New Orleans. Fine dining and transportation all within walking distance. Well worth the money, I will stay here again!</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a great hotel.</span></div></div>
