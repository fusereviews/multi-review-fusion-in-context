<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>On my first trip to Turkey, a friend and I decided to go to Istanbul a few days early and found the Hotel Nena website. We had a great time. The hotel offers airport pickup with a driver who is quite above the average taxi you might take from the airport. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms were very comfortable</span> and the food served at the hotel was delicious. Many hotels in Istanbul offer poor breakfasts of Tang and tired food. (We had this at the group hotel.) <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The Hotel Nena offered fresh orange juice, strawberries, melon and other healthy and fresh food.</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>The restaurant terrace is above the Blue Mosque</span>, the hotel is convenient to the tram line, there is a lovely garden area to relax and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the personnel at the hotel were helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and friendly.</span></div><div class='text-box'>We stayed at the Nena Hotel for 5 nights. We upgraded to a deluxe room (#401), and we were very happy with our choice. We had a lovely view of the Blue Mosque and also the bridge crossing to the modern side of Istanbul. We had heard from others that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the standard rooms are small</span>; for five nights <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the larger room was great</span>. We LOVED staying in the old part of Istanbul, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Nena Hotel was perfectly located for exploring so many parts of that area</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The staff</span> at the Nena Hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>were</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>friendly and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>quite helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast buffet was very plentiful</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the view from the restaurant terrace was very nice</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>The Nena Hotel was excellent. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is close to all of the major sites in the historic part of Istanbul</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A SHORT walk to the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque</span>, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and the Grand Bazaar</span>. A slightly longer walk will take you to the shore to enjoy the sea and the restaurants that line the piers. The tram to Taksim Square - the trendy, hipster hot spot - is close to the hotel. The hotel is well decorated and comfortable. The room and the bathroom were very nice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The hotel staff was helpful</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>and friendly</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The breakfast was enjoyable</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>We were recently, May 17 -20th, at the Nena Hotel. The service was excellent and the accommodations were very comfortable. The location is central in the historical Istanbul, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>all the main sights are within a few blocks from the hotel</span>. All in all a very comfortable way to spend some time in Istanbul. The price for such proximity to the sights of Istanbul is hard to beat and the service is the friendliest possible. The Hotel also makes free wi-fi available to the residents. We intend to go back to Istanbul and we would certainly stay at the Nena Hotel, without a doubt.</div><div class='text-box'>I would recommend this hotel to all travelers. it has great service and is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>very clean and extremely comfortable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The staff was always very helpful</span> and the food was great. The hotel is approx 20 meters from the Blue line tram which can get you almost anywhere within 5-10 min. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>from the roof top terrace there is a lounge where they serve a great breakfast and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 4'>the views of the Hagia Sophia and the blue Mosque are great</span>. the sights and sounds of the area along with the kindness of the people will make this a "for sure" stay on my next visit.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is situated just five minutes away from Ayia Sofia and the blue mosque</span> and two minutes from the tram station, so any area can be reached very easily. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The rooms are very clean</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the personnel is more than willing to make your stay memorable</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>You enjoy your breakfast watching the view of Ayia Sofia and the Blue Mosque</span> and the food both at breakfast and dinner is very carefully prepared and delicious. The transfer service from the airport to the hotel and otherwise was very convenient because you didn't need to mess with the taxi drivers at the airport.</div><div class='text-box'>The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hotel</span> Nena is the perfect place to stay in Istanbul. It <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is within a 2 minute walk from</span> both St. Sophia's and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Blue Mosque</span>. The view of the Blue Mosque from the Hotel Nena is superb. Ask to stay in room 401, which has a large balcony overlooking the sea and all the sights, including the Blue Mosque. The hotel <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>staff was wonderful and helpful in every way</span>. I will always stay at the Hotel Nena in the future.</div><div class='text-box'>My family and I stayed at the Hotel Nena in October 2008 and October 2009. On both occasions <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2 3'>we found the hotel to be very comfortable</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>the staff very</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>friendly and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>helpful</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The view of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia</span> and Sea of Marmara <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>from the hotel restaurant is wonderful</span></div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is ideally situated within a few minutes walking distance of attractions such as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and the Grand Bazaar.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The staff are superb.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">They were all eager that we enjoyed our stay and were very helpful with advice and service.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast buffet is excellent and there is a spectaclular view over the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia from the Terrace Restaurant.</span></div></div>
