<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We chose the Hilton <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Bonaventure</span> for our recent stay in Montreal based on the glowing recommendation of a frequent flying family member. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The downtown location proved to be a great</span> starting point for our city explorations. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>room was clean</span>, well laid out, and comfortable. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff was courteous</span> and al spoke flawless English. One evening we decided to sample some local ice wine we had purchased, the hotel quickly brought us glasses, opened, and then served us our wine. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3 4'>The breakfast was delicious</span>, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>the selection at the bar was above average</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The rooftop garden was beautiful</span>, although we didnat have time to walk though it in its entirety. Over all <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>I give this hotel my full recommendation</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Hilton Bonaventure definitely provides bang for your buck</span>. The layout for this hotel is very unique. It has many "wings" and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>each wing has access to its own private pool</span>. It also has many water features and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>excellent landscaping</span> throughout the outdoor patios <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>that are accessible privately via the rooms</span>. You don't even realize that you are on the 17th floor once you get off the main elevator at the reception level and the view of the city from that floor is breathtaking. The staff is quite friendly and accomodating. The only drawback: wired interenet only available for 1 computer in each room. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Wireless internet is only available in the lobby</span>. However, I enjoyed my stay!</div><div class='text-box'>Recently in Montreal to attend a concert with my teen Grand daughter and her friend. We chose <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>the Bonaventure</span> after much consideration due to it's proximity to the bell Centre( concert Venue and also Hockey Game Venue which my husband was attending). The decision could not have been better.<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The Bonaventure is connected to Montreal's extensive underground City, lots of shopping, a skating rink, movie theatres.we</span> were thrilled. To say nothing of the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>friendly hotel staff.to</span> a person they <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were helpful and welcoming</span>. This <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>is obviously a very well run facility</span>. The management and staff should be proud.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There are no elevators and the staff doesn't tell you</span>. I had to drag my bags upstairs and then downstairs. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>There were no bellmans available</span> when we arrived. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>It was horrible for $100US per night</span>. When I asked for a closer room, I was given a downgraded room. I've never stayed at a 4 star hotel without elevators and no bellmen. Also, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>the drain in the bathtub was very slow</span>. You end up showering in 4 inches of water.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>hotel in central downtown location</span>. Comfortable, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>the greatest asset is the garden with swimming pool</span> on the top floor is even heated in winter ! Book a room on the executive floor and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>enjoy complimentary breakfast and evening appetizers and snacks for a small fee</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A perfect hotel to stay in the city</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Wonderful quality hotel</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The garden</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>pool are a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>great escape</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>from the city below</span>. The room was clean, comfortable and tastefully renovated - very modern yet so comfy. The staff was very helpful and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>the location of the hotel is perfect for every sight in Montreal</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Was participating at a business convention in Montreal. We stayed at this hotel. Nice hotel with <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5'>comfortable beds and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1 5'>nice view</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>of downtown Montreal</span>. Near Place Bonaventure. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Closed to Bell centre</span> and all fancy restaurant around.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everything about this hotel was fine</span>. It is a typical, better-than-averagely run downtown Hilton property. I went there for a few days on business and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>ended up liking it a lot</span>.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">The Bonaventure Hotel provides a lot for the cost and is wonderful.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">This hotel's location is great as it is in central downtown and close to the Bell Center and connected to the underground city for shopping and entertainment.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Rooms are close to a private pool, with there being a pool for each wing of the hotel, and guests have private access to the beautiful landscaping that surrounds their rooms.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">This hotel includes an executive floor to book, where breakfast is complimentary or in the evening appetizers and snacks are at a minimal cost.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast is very good too and they have a lot on offer at the bar as well.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">There is only wireless internet available in the lobby but everything else about the hotel is fine enough.</span></div></div>
