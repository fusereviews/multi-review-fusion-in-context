<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>I did a tour with Tour East which included High Tea at Raffles Hotel. I had been told it was great but had to do it to find out how good! I <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>would recomend it to any one</span> that asks! I also did the Tour East Tour that included a Singapore Sling at Raffles, I opted out of the Singapore Sling for $29.50,Thought it was over priced. I can understand some one who says having the Singapore Sling as a memorable experience, to note as having done it. Tick it off as been there done that. I can say the same as having just experiencing the aura of The Long Bar and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>treading on peanut shells as an experience</span> in itself. Can recomend to anyone thinking of doing these tours or others with Tour East. Very professional group Thank you for a wonderful holiday.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>This one is easy</span>. Go there, try to make it to a table without slipping on the (<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>signature) peanut shells on the floor</span>. A Singapore sling (comes in several flavours) is 26 SGD plus 17 percent. The place is normally crowded, yes there is even a queue at the door at times. The place is full of tourists, Americans are there in large numbers. The toilets around the corner are totally out of character with the Raffles hotel in particular and Singapore standards in general. Hence try to avoid them. The hotel is very neat, the beautiful reception is closed to non-guests and the restaurants of top class. The Long bar is there for tourists and the profit only. It could as well be closed as it no longer has anything to do with the hotel as such.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Very disappointed with the afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The sandwiches had been made for hours and the bread was very dry</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>Not much selection of other food</span>. Must say the service was excellent and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>all staff at the hotel were pleasant</span>. We stayed at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and are sorry now that we did not partake of their aftenoon tea service, but Raffles being Raffles, we thought it was going to be "the tops".</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Whats not to like about the Raffles Hotel Singapore</span>? <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff is almost perfect in their service and attentiveness</span>. The rooms are exquisite. The hotel is gorgeous and a nice oasis in the midst of an urban landscape. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Its a beautiful place</span> with an appropriately high-class staff that gives excellent recommendations for restaurants, tourist information, and navigating the city. We think everyone deserves to stay here at least once in his or her lifetime.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>Bed was super comfy</span>, c, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>water power is strong</span> - something which I miss in some hotels. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>Room was also equipped with DVD player</span> - <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>it was useful one afternoon when it rained so hard</span> so we spent the time watching films. Other than that, the rest of our stay was wonderful and we'd surely come .</div><div class='text-box'>The Spa is out of this world. Expensive but fabulous. Restaurants are great. Overall I would say this is <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>probably the best hotel we have ever stayed</span>.</div><div class='text-box'>Bit pricey but <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>loved it</span>, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>rooms amazing</span> so many service buttons didnt know which to press would stay again in a flash on any special occasion</div><div class='text-box'>The hotel is well located, Very beautiful rooms, <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>good breakfast</span> & location. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>The staff was</span> exceedingly <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>friendly</span> and helpful.</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This is a no-brainer - it's the best hotel to stay in and is absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">The bed was super comfortable and the water pressure was strong in the bathroom.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">Additionally the room features a DVD player that came in really useful when it rained so much.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The staff at the hotel were very pleasant to guests.</span><span id="4" class="summary-sentence">, The food was disappointing.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The experience here involves peanut shells on the floor - in fact it is a tradition at this hotel!</span></div></div>
