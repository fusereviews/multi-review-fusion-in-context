<div class='column reviews'><h2>Reviews</h2><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the Locanda Sant'Agostin in January '06, we were <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>very impressed with the quality and friendliness of the service</span> we received. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>Our room was very quiet</span>,<span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'> if not a little cold</span>, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>Breakfast was basic continental style</span>, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this. We <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience Venice</span>, you really can walk anywhere from the Hotel, the Rialto Bridge and St Marks are only a few minutes walk away. A brilliant holiday - thank you Locando Sant'Agostin we'll be sending our parents your way next year!</div><div class='text-box'>My husband and I, as well as another couple reserved 2 rooms on the internet and were very happy with the <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>accommodations</span>. They <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>were clean, comfortable, charming, centrallly located, and</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 5 6'>breakfast was a nice start</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5 6'>to the day with yoghurt, cappuccino, coissants, cereal</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='4'>The rooms were decorated with old world charm</span> and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the bathrooms were newly upgraded</span>. The staff was very friendly and helpful. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The location was walking distance to all of Venice. It is easiest to take a water taxi</span> or the walk has many bridges and steps for you to navigate with your luggage. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='7'>-Great value</span>. Loved Venice and Locanda Sant'Agostin Loretta and Vincent</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel</span>; it is all about service and making sure the guests are comfortable. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff are so helpful and so pleasant</span>. We stayed in <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>the apt nearby</span> and found it <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='3'>spacious</span> and clean, and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>it gave us a flavour of how Venetians live</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>The hotel is</span> away from the main tourist drag but it is still <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>in a</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>great location, not far from the water-ferry station and Rialto</span>,and <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='2'>quite close to a couple of great restaurants</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>The Locanda Sant'Agostin was a delight in every way</span>. The hotel is a <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>historic beauty with a pleasant surprise of</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 3'>a large spacious room</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>and bathroom</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>The location was ideal;</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2 3'>situated off a quiet plaza</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1 2'>but within easy walking distance to our destinations</span>.The staff was very friendly and helpful; their English speaking skills were somewhat limited but not problematic. Our stay was very pleasant and I highly recommend this hotel.</div><div class='text-box'>We stayed in the apartment next to the hotel which was spacious, comfortable and clean and a great price for Venice. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>Breakfast next door at the hotel was lovely</span> and the breakfast lady is very warm and friendly. The staff at reception could not have been more helpful, booking us tickets to a concert, recommending places to visit and restaurants to eat. Would definitely come back and stay again.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>A nice and friendly atmosphere</span>. <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>Everyone were very helpful</span> in helping us with arrangement of a water taxi pickup early Sunday morning. It is located so you can easily (< 5 min) reach the places where the Venezians go out. I am sure that <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>we will consider this place, the next time we go to Venezia</span>.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>The hotel was</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>ideally located in the centre of Venice</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>but in a nice quiet situation</span>. The <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the hotel was spotlessly clean</span>. I would certainly recommend this hotel and when I return to Venice will look no further.</div><div class='text-box'><span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0 1'>ideal place to stay</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='1'>right in the heart of real Venice</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='0'>clean comfortable and elegant rooms</span> <span class='review-span highlight' data-aligned-summaries='5'>very good breakfast</span> very efficient and helpfull staff definetely i will stay again in my nxt visit</div></div><div class='column summary'><h4>Summary</h4><div class='summary-box'><span id="0" class="summary-sentence">This hotel makes for a really pleasant and delightful stay.</span> <span id="1" class="summary-sentence">You wouldn't want to stay anywhere else if returning to Venice.</span> <span id="2" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is perfectly situated to get to great restaurants and it's close to water-ferry stations.</span> <span id="3" class="summary-sentence">The room in the hotel had a spacious, newly decorated bathroom and a quiet room in general.</span> <span id="4" class="summary-sentence">The rooms are decorated with a respect for history.</span> <span id="5" class="summary-sentence">The breakfast was a little bit basic</span> <span id="6" class="summary-sentence">but it was still a good start to the day with continental-style yoghurts, cereals etc.</span> <span id="7" class="summary-sentence">The hotel is great value for money.</span></div></div>
