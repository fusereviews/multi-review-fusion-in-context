CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_0_a_summ_0,The staff at the hotel were incredibly accommodating and the hotel was well located.,"Our company has rented conference rooms and held many meetings and corporate events at Place D'Armes and we were extremely satisfied with their service. There was always someone to greet and help with the setup and make sure we have everything we needed. More importantly, technical service was efficient and really went out of their way (even when it is your own equipment). The rooms are clean and beautiful and staff is great. The only negative thing is that they charge for the conference room for the whole day regardless if you only need it for half a day or an hour.","[[414, 428]]",The hotel is located in the OLD Town part of Montreal by the Notre Dame Cathedral and short walking distance to the rivers edge. This hotel was a great value and the staff and location were excellent. There are 2 restaurants in the hotel that are very highly rated. The staff and service were excellent. The rooms are specious and nicely decorated The bathrooms are very nice with very big bathtubs. There is also a roof terrace to have drinks and enjoy the views. Couldn't use because it was raining.,"[[4, 36], [270, 302]]","We just returned from a mid-winter weekend get away to Montreal. We picked this hotel due to its location in Old Montreal, close to restaurants, Notre Dame and the cobblestone streets. From the moment we arrived when the valet service looked after the car until we checked out the service of the staff was top notch. The rooms were nice with hardwood floors and exposed brick. The bar, Suite701, is the perfect spot for a night cap. We would definately return.","[[277, 315], [65, 183]]",Absolutely one of the best places to stay while visiting old city Montreal. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooftop bar and restaurant was beautiful with a view of Notre Dame Basilica. We stayed in Junior Suite 3402 and really appreciated the ambiance and decor. If I were to visit again I would think of staying in 3602 (second digit is the floor). The street noise was not bad however you will have early morning local truck deliveries.,"[[76, 117], [0, 41], [164, 198]]","Lovely hotel in an historic building with a fantastic location. Nice rooms, very friendly and service-oriented staff. Great little touches like chocolates on the pillow and turn-down service. Very helpful concierge.

Close enough to walk to Mont Royal.","[[7, 12], [37, 62], [94, 116]]","Stayed in one of the Suites which we got using one of the major credit card upgrades.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_0_b_summ_0,The staff at the hotel were incredibly accommodating and the hotel was well located.,"My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.","[[513, 575]]","I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.","[[47, 56], [89, 189], [582, 586], [587, 608]]","This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel.

Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere."", ""review_1_text"": ""I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access."", ""review_2_text"": ""This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor that has a plaque that says \""Give Peace A Chance\"". The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was too small. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_3_a_summ_0,The hotel is highly recommended. It is in a great location and the staff at the hotel are very amiable and helpful to guests' needs.,"I travel to Vancouver regularly on business and always stay at the Sutton Place Hotel. It is truly a top end hotel from the well appointed lobby, excellent restaurant, beautiful guest suites and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile and no request is considered too small. I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying ""Welcome back to the Sutton Place"". The beds are very comfortable, you get an excellent sleep. The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver but the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner!","[[754, 846], [304, 338], [248, 299], [851, 921]]","Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient for shopping and eating - lots of great locations around. Service was spot-on from all the staff. The hotel is a bit old but everything was still clean and renovated. Rooms were roomy and beds really comfortable. I only have 2 complaints - the parking is outrageous (40$ per night), and the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day). I think the hotel would be much better value if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges! Can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!","[[532, 567], [37, 97], [156, 194]]","I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used Room Service, which was excellent. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service). The ""gift shop"" is really more of a convenience store than a gift shop, but there are plenty of other souvenir-type shops around. Convenient walk to shops, restaurants and the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre. Very, very comfortable bed. (No back pain, yay!)","[[145, 157], [165, 178], [361, 455], [361, 455], [145, 157], [165, 178]]","We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite. The rooms were lovely - plenty of room for three of us, beautiful views, very quiet. We had wi-fi and continental breakfast included in our rate - the wi-fi worked flawlessly and the morning pastries were delicious. Service in this hotel is top rate - the concierges helped us with car rental, spa and restaurant reservations. And the location couldn't be better. We were able to walk everywhere downtown. We highly recommend Sutton Place.","[[262, 295], [452, 484], [377, 408], [262, 371]]","This was my third time staying at Sutton Place and love staying here. Great location, clean rooms, comfortable beds, friendly/helpful staff. However, I don't recommend eating breakfast at the restaurant, pretty spendy for what you get. Maybe the buffet is the better way to go. Parking is spendy but hotel usually has a deal that helps cover the cost of parking. But this is my hotel of choice when I come to Vancouver!","[[70, 84], [126, 139], [117, 125], [134, 139]]","First the service at Sutton Place was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is also great. Unfortunately the hotel itself is outdated and the rooms are in need of an upgrade. The price was very reasonable, but it would be nice to see this hotel receive a much needed makeover.","[[48, 115]]",We were pleased with the location of this Hotel as it is only a 10 minute downhill walk from Canada Place from where the Cruise Ships depart. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Hotel is very close to the main shopping area and across the road we were able to catch the Hop-on Hop-off Trolley Tour.,"[[182, 227]]","It is central to all downtown activities and the staff are friendly,and helpful. The restaurant is great with always a little chef's surprise. We also enjoy the pool which has good hours for use.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_3_b_summ_0,The hotel is highly recommended. It is in a great location and the staff at the hotel are very amiable and helpful to guests' needs.,"We stayed at L'Hermitage in Aug. 2008, just two months after it opened. It is a very sleek, modern hotel in a great location in downtown Vancouver. Because it was so new, the staff seemed to still be figuring things out. For example, we weren't able to check into our room the first night for over an hour after the guaranteed check-in time. To make up for this, the staff comped a round of drinks for us at their wonderful guest lounge on the 5th floor. The website did not do this place justice . there's a beautiful rooftop pool and hot tub and the rooms are large and luxuorious. Very nice breakfast and afternoon h'or doeurve buffets are included in the price. The staff was very friendly and made sure that all of our needs were met. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be pampered in Vancouver!","[[740, 775], [92, 124], [666, 738]]","We will use this again. We stayed on 3 separate occasions in quick succession. The staff were always helpful, charming and friendly, the rooms elegant and spacious (wonderful bathrooms) and the location was great, particularly if you are flying in (2 blocks down from Vancouver City Centre station on the Canada Line. Don't even think about a cab, on a Sunday when there is no $5 surcharge it cost under $6 for my wife and me to get to the airport. Heathrow and London Underground hang your heads in shame).

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_5_a_summ_0,The rooms of the hotel are clean and the hotel is definitely recommended. The hotel is in walking distance to the sights. Despite being quite pricey the breakfast was super tasty and sumptuous.,"- First thing is the location, no need for public transport, we could walk from hotel to anywhere. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - Very clean, tidy and a safe hotel for reasonable price. -I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it to friends.","[[563, 579], [563, 617], [619, 676], [157, 213], [101, 149], [214, 245]]","Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time. The room was immaculate, and the bed amazingly comfortable to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two. Great location too. We paid for a cab from Central St on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and was only a 5 minute ride. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick.

It didn't disappoint on either count and had the added bonus of being in an excellent location - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful. The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again.","[[351, 406], [532, 562], [292, 349]]","The Hotel is perfectly placed for both travel and entertainment on the edge of Rembrandt Square.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_5_b_summ_0,The rooms of the hotel are clean and the hotel is definitely recommended. The hotel is in walking distance to the sights. Despite being quite pricey the breakfast was super tasty and sumptuous.,"Located on the Herengracht, one of the old canal rings encircling the city, the Ambassade is beautifully decorated - we were open-mouthed at the quality of the furnishings. And it was staffed with friendly, knowledgeable, multilingual employees. The location was perfect - we were within walking distance of museums, the Dam, the Red Light District, the Begjinhof, great restaurants and bars (we loved the Five Flies just around the corner, built in 1634). The breakfast was sumptuous, but seemed a bit pricey, so we only tried it once. WE stayed for 3 nights, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","[[246, 270], [565, 598], [273, 363], [457, 509]]","Stayed in this hotel on Saturday night for a very brief visit to the City. The staff at reception were exceptionally, kind and help and just couldn't do enough for us. Joost Van Der Kwaak led the charge here and was amazing. The rooms are divine, very large and beautifully decorated - the most comfortable beds and pillows - we even managed to get a room with a superb view over the canal. I loved the fact that everything is within walking distance - the museums, flower market etc. Will definitely go back. Yes it's a little pricey but well worth every penny!","[[225, 323], [485, 508], [413, 483], [510, 561]]","We stayed there for around 5 days in April of this year and would definitely stay there again if finances allow. The staff was very friendly and professional. The room was very nice and clean. We had a room overlooking the canal so that made it even nicer. Free wireless internet in the room. Nice clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. The location is also great, it was pretty much walking distance from everything we wanted to do. It was pretty expensive, but I do believe you get what you pay for - high quality! No complaints at all.","[[159, 191], [60, 93], [378, 426], [378, 426], [428, 494]]","The staff was amazingly handy in every aspect. I simply found the hotel in Trip Advisor, never heard about. They rent bicycles themselves, so you are not attached to the time of rental stores. For example you can return the bike in the middle of dawn. Nice and stylish rooms.

They are all run down (at least the 3 we saw), items are missing and not replaced, i.e. soap dishes, etc. The carpeting is torn and worn. The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy. All the rooms we saw smell from odor. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion.

We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights.","[[314, 355], [467, 489], [314, 355], [369, 396]]","Would recommend this hotel.

We found that the stafff was extremely helpful and gave us advice on the various activities that we should participate in and would help us to sign up for them. If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place but it was perfect for what we needed. The rooms are small and there is no pool on site.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_6_a_summ_1,This hotel is highly recommended. The location of this hotel is perfect and not only provides great views but also close to the beach. The staff provide a really great friendly but professional service.,"Terrible disappointment Maybe a 1 or 2 star, but NOT 4! The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and thoughtful.The rooms were a disappointment. They are all run down (at least the 3 we saw), items are missing and not replaced, i.e. soap dishes, etc. The carpeting is torn and worn. The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy. All the rooms we saw smell from odor. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion.

The elevator is not large enough for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby."", ""review_1_text"": ""Great little hotel! We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights."", ""review_2_text"": ""Would recommend this hotel. We stayed at this hotel in October of 2005 for 7 days. The hotel was small but we knew that when we made our reservations. We found that the stafff was extremely helpful and gave us advice on the various activities that we should participate in and would help us to sign up for them. If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place but it was perfect for what we needed. The rooms are small and there is no pool on site. Being across the street from the beach we wouldn't have used the pool anyways. We thought that is was in the perfect location, we were able to walk to everything.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_6_b_summ_0,This is a hotel resort that's in a good location for seeing the nearby ocean and beach and a good view of Hawaii. The staff at the hotel were very professional. Would definitely recommend the hotel.,"great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat and would recommend it without hesitation.","[[590, 613], [537, 560], [615, 685], [901, 938]]","There's no place like HHV!

The staff provide a really great friendly but professional service.,"great place We got back a week ago from a week long stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.) I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat and would recommend it without hesitation.","[[852, 881], [897, 938], [615, 646], [590, 613], [537, 560]]","There's no place like HHV!

You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for!

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_7_a_summ_0,The hotel is recommended and the staff were really helpful. The location is just near to the Piazza Navona.,"Like the other reviewers, I have to say this hotel is close to perfect. The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-modern rooms on the two ""executive"" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, just off Piazza Navona in the historical center, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!","[[40, 70], [290, 319], [321, 344], [411, 433], [450, 465], [516, 538], [454, 514]]","Our second stay here in 12 months and the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return to Rome, just so I can stay here again! The location is second to none and we have been able to walk to all the main sights from here. We have stayed in three different rooms at this hotel and they have all been fabulous. The buffet breakfast is very good and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!","[[533, 577], [38, 109], [622, 661]]","We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated Richard Meier rooms, which was very nice, with a spacious bathroom and clever use of the available space. The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain, and the elevator needs a small facelift, but nonetheless it was fuctional and the guest doesn't spend any time there. Breakfast was quite good, especially for Italy, and the location just off piazza Navona, ideal. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc.","[[532, 639], [488, 530]]","Hotel Raphael is absolutely gorgeous! It is very comfortable, clean and quiet. A reasonable journey from Campiano Airport should cost you no more than 40 euro. Our sheets were changed every day and the delicious chocolates on our bed every night were fantastic. The Bulgari toiletries smell gorgeous so enjoyed several long soaks in the bath. Breakfast is amazing, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful.

CocoTrip,dev_comm,inst_7_b_summ_0,The hotel is recommended and the staff were really helpful. The location is just near to the Piazza Navona.,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner in August '09. The hotel is located 50m around the corner from the famous Campo De 'Fiori which is a wonderful area for eating and drinking as well as having great nightlife. The room itself was beautifully done in a period setting. Bed was large and aircon was fine. Staff extremely passionate and friendly about when and where to see the sights. Location is excellent as only a 5 minute walk to the piazza navona, 10 min walk to the trevi fountain and pantheon and 15 min walk to Vaticano and Colosseum. Also only a 10 min walk to the river and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife. There is a viewing deck above the top floor which is great to relax and have a few drinks and offers a really nice view of the area as well which was a bonus!

Also only a 10 min walk to the river and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife.

The photos on the web site are accurate and the roof-top deck is a dream! The breakfast was ample with excellent coffee. The best thing about the hotel is the amazing staff - Valentina, Matteo, Barbara, Gabriele, Angelo, Adam, Andrea & Andrew - not only efficient and well-versed on the city, they were kind hearted and lovely.

Unfortunately the hotel is missing the availability of a pool.","Our company has rented conference rooms and held many meetings and corporate events at Place D'Armes and we were extremely satisfied with their service. There was always someone to greet and help with the setup and make sure we have everything we needed. More importantly, technical service was efficient and really went out of their way (even when it is your own equipment). The rooms are clean and beautiful and staff is great. The only negative thing is that they charge for the conference room for the whole day regardless if you only need it for half a day or an hour.","[[16, 39], [63, 83], [376, 389], [400, 409]]",The hotel is located in the OLD Town part of Montreal by the Notre Dame Cathedral and short walking distance to the rivers edge.

From the moment we arrived when the valet service looked after the car until we checked out the service of the staff was top notch. The rooms were nice with hardwood floors and exposed brick.

The rooms are nice and spacious with good decoration too. The bathrooms are really great because there are massive bathtubs and lovely rainfall showers. A nice touch is the turn-down service with cute chocolates left on the pillows. The staff at Le Place D'Armes is great. Really good service overall.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_0_b_summ_0,"The hotel is especially memorable during a winter stay. The room was okay but on the small side including the bathroom as well. After upgrading rooms to a suite this was absolutely fine and had a great view with modern decor. Whilst the breakfast and dinners are both quite expensive they're really great and tasty. But a coffee maker and coffee was not free of charge, which is unusual. Whilst the toiletries were really great there was an issue with the toilet.","My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.","[[145, 208], [145, 186], [218, 246], [436, 503], [272, 303]]","I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.","[[468, 543], [191, 208], [215, 230]]","This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor that has a plaque that says ""Give Peace A Chance"". The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was too small. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue. Beyond these comments it is a nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff.","[[182, 236], [292, 311], [317, 339], [313, 339], [442, 531]]",We spent a night at the Queen E with our grandchildren - it is a very nice place to stay - somewhat expensive but right in the center of Montreal.

I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal.

I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying ""Welcome back to the Sutton Place"".

Some of the charges could stand to be dropped to improve the hotel experience but it is not disappointing here. Perfect location as it is walking distance to all amenities and major attractions in the area. The rooms at this hotel are very clean and the beds in particular are very comfortable; perfect for a good night's sleep. They are also spacious and fully equipped for your stay, making the visit relaxed and stress-free, however they are in need of an upgrade. The food at this hotel is delicious, and is particularly pricey if you choose to eat in the restaurant as opposed to the buffet style breakfast on offer.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_5_a_summ_0,"The hotel is great and provides a safe place to stay. It is a favourite with guests. The hotel is close to the metro line and Rembrandt Square and away from the louder tourist areas. The room was quite small at this hotel but it was quite modern and clean. Everything was wheelchair-accessible which was fantastic, even if there was no shower curtain and it left the bathroom floor somewhat wet. The staff at the front desk were unhelpful to guests. The hotel provides a fantastic selection of food in their seafood bistro. The WiFi in the hotel lobby is very slow. The carpet was dirty and the exterior of the hotel is noisy and overcrowded.","- First thing is the location, no need for public transport, we could walk from hotel to anywhere. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs. I remember one was awesome, one was terrible, and in the third we couldn't enter, the tickets were sold out. And there is a great coffeshop just by the entrance of hotel :D - Very clean, tidy and a safe hotel for reasonable price. -I'm definintely sleeping there again and recommending it to friends.","[[563, 617], [619, 687], [101, 149], [214, 245]]","Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time.

We paid for a cab from Central St on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and was only a 5 minute ride. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick.

With the hotel being only five minutes from the metro station access to travel and entertainment near Rembrandt Square or you can simply walk to most places. The rooms are very nice with great bathrooms. and the beds are so comfortable. Some rooms are on the small side and some are wheelchair friendly. Particularly rude member of staff on the reception desk that is very unhelpful. This hotel has a great seafood bistro restauraunt. Although there is Wi-Fi available at this hotel, it can be very slow and the staff aren't the most efficient at helping guests log in. The hotel is also quite dirty, particularly the carpets, and it can get very noisy and crowded in places.","- First thing is the location, no need for public transport, we could walk from hotel to anywhere. - No need for the expencive hotel breakfast 'cause in the walking distance of 20-50 meters on the Rembrandt square there are cheaper places to eat. - We got a deal in the hotel and got one night for free. - In the same walking distance- on the rembrandt square- there are couple of clubs.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_5_b_summ_0,"The stay at the hotel was quite expensive, but absolutely worth the cost. No complaints. The view from the room was great because it overlooked the canal. The wireless internet in the room was free, which is really useful. Even better though is that the rooms are luxurious and decorated to a lovely standard. All of the staff were lovely because they were friendly but professional at the same time. They were clearly very knowledgeable, which was just wonderful. The hotel provided free internet services and also the use of a printer too if needed.","Located on the Herengracht, one of the old canal rings encircling the city, the Ambassade is beautifully decorated - we were open-mouthed at the quality of the furnishings. And it was staffed with friendly, knowledgeable, multilingual employees. The location was perfect - we were within walking distance of museums, the Dam, the Red Light District, the Begjinhof, great restaurants and bars (we loved the Five Flies just around the corner, built in 1634). The breakfast was sumptuous, but seemed a bit pricey, so we only tried it once. WE stayed for 3 nights, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","[[497, 509], [537, 598], [565, 599], [76, 114], [180, 244], [180, 196], [207, 220], [235, 244]]","Stayed in this hotel on Saturday night for a very brief visit to the City. The staff at reception were exceptionally, kind and help and just couldn't do enough for us. Joost Van Der Kwaak led the charge here and was amazing. The rooms are divine, very large and beautifully decorated - the most comfortable beds and pillows - we even managed to get a room with a superb view over the canal. I loved the fact that everything is within walking distance - the museums, flower market etc. Will definitely go back. Yes it's a little pricey but well worth every penny!","[[514, 534], [539, 561], [326, 389], [225, 238], [262, 283], [75, 166]]","We stayed there for around 5 days in April of this year and would definitely stay there again if finances allow.

Nice clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. The location is also great, it was pretty much walking distance from everything we wanted to do.

The hotel does offer free internet and if you need it you can use their printer.","Located on the Herengracht, one of the old canal rings encircling the city, the Ambassade is beautifully decorated - we were open-mouthed at the quality of the furnishings. And it was staffed with friendly, knowledgeable, multilingual employees. The location was perfect - we were within walking distance of museums, the Dam, the Red Light District, the Begjinhof, great restaurants and bars (we loved the Five Flies just around the corner, built in 1634). The breakfast was sumptuous, but seemed a bit pricey, so we only tried it once. WE stayed for 3 nights, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","[[117, 171], [246, 363], [273, 391], [173, 244]]","Stayed in this hotel on Saturday night for a very brief visit to the City. The staff at reception were exceptionally, kind and help and just couldn't do enough for us. Joost Van Der Kwaak led the charge here and was amazing. The rooms are divine, very large and beautifully decorated - the most comfortable beds and pillows - we even managed to get a room with a superb view over the canal. I loved the fact that everything is within walking distance - the museums, flower market etc. Will definitely go back. Yes it's a little pricey but well worth every penny!","[[286, 323], [229, 283], [413, 483], [413, 464], [349, 389], [286, 311], [225, 238], [247, 257], [75, 131]]","We stayed there for around 5 days in April of this year and would definitely stay there again if finances allow. The staff was very friendly and professional. The room was very nice and clean. We had a room overlooking the canal so that made it even nicer. Free wireless internet in the room. Nice clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. The location is also great, it was pretty much walking distance from everything we wanted to do. It was pretty expensive, but I do believe you get what you pay for - high quality! No complaints at all.","[[428, 509], [314, 329], [331, 426], [159, 171], [207, 228], [314, 329], [113, 157], [257, 291]]","The staff was amazingly handy in every aspect. I simply found the hotel in Trip Advisor, never heard about. They rent bicycles themselves, so you are not attached to the time of rental stores. For example you can return the bike in the middle of dawn. Nice and stylish rooms. They upgraded me to a better room with canal view. They respond to all e-mails, request. They are 100%.","[[0, 45], [305, 326], [0, 45]]","Spent a night at this very comfortable hotel. One of the most comfortable rooms I have ever been in. Everything is perfect. Hotel is centrally located bu quiet. Just be careful ate at night to remember which side of the canal the hotel is on, if you forget, you may be wandering around for a while. Free Internet and a printer too if you need it.","[[22, 99], [101, 122], [299, 312], [331, 345], [299, 345]]","Right in the center, close (walking distance) to everything you had to see in Amsterdam, bathroom is very, very clean.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_6_a_summ_0,"This is a really great little hotel. It isn't a full-on resort but it was nice all the same. There are many things to do within walking distance. The hotel rooms are smaller, but clean and furnished well with antiques for some charm. The breakfast at the hotel was adequate. The coffee was great. There were some items missing and there was a run-down feel here. The carpeting did not help with the worn-down atmosphere. The elevators weren't that big either meaning a surfboard could not even fit in it.","Terrible disappointment Maybe a 1 or 2 star, but NOT 4! The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and thoughtful.The rooms were a disappointment. They are all run down (at least the 3 we saw), items are missing and not replaced, i.e. soap dishes, etc. The carpeting is torn and worn. The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy. All the rooms we saw smell from odor. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion. The elevator is not large enough for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby.","[[0, 43], [24, 54], [341, 377], [144, 165], [191, 225], [250, 280], [488, 549]]","Great little hotel! We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights.","[[0, 18], [314, 367], [369, 387]]","Would recommend this hotel.

We found that the stafff was extremely helpful and gave us advice on the various activities that we should participate in and would help us to sign up for them. If your looking for full on resort than this is not your place but it was perfect for what we needed. The rooms are small and there is no pool on site.

I would recommend this hotel and would also stay here again.","[[414, 433]]","Fab Location Literally across the road from Waikik beach, easy walk to all Waikik has to offer. Understand hotel has recently been bought by Aqua chain and looks as if it will be undergoing renovation in the near future - scaffolding all around hotel during my stay with workmen there friom 9 - 5. Interior does need updating and is rather worn and dated - however, location compensates for this.Breakfast is a bit of a joke though and unless you are there when it goes out forget it, my 1st morning there I arrived at about 8.15am to be told there was nothing left! Even when there there is food left it's poor quality muffins only.","[[107, 112], [156, 244], [396, 424], [567, 632], [298, 354]]","Great Staff, superb location - will be back !

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_6_a_summ_2,"This is a great hotel with nice touches but not a full resort some might look for. It appeared to be having renovation work as there was scaffolding and workmen there. Also, the AC barely worked and was noisy. The hotel is within walking distance to everything such as the International Market Place. Whilst clean and pretty nice the rooms aren't large at all and a little disappointing. Breakfast is average, but it can be enjoyed next to the indoor atrium for guests to enjoy. The carpet is in need of replacement and items in the room such as soap dishes were missing. The elevators were too small as well.","Terrible disappointment Maybe a 1 or 2 star, but NOT 4! The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and thoughtful.The rooms were a disappointment. They are all run down (at least the 3 we saw), items are missing and not replaced, i.e. soap dishes, etc. The carpeting is torn and worn. The Air conditioners barely work, and are rusty and noisy. All the rooms we saw smell from odor. We had to pay to Upgrade to the top floor to get a halfway decent room, which is still 2 star in my opinion. The elevator is not large enough for a surfboard to fit in it (kind of ironic don't you think), so you have to leave your board in a lockup room in the lobby.","[[282, 339], [111, 142], [341, 377], [189, 248], [250, 280], [488, 520]]","Great little hotel! We stayed here for two days before leaving the islands after getting married on Kaua`i in August, 2004. We booked with the Entertainment Card discount, so the price ?even with daily parking ?was great. I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice. Upon hearing that we just got married, the desk clerk upgraded us to a full ocean view room and sent up a split of champagne ?a very nice touch. Needless to say, the view was spectacular and we enjoyed having a glass of wine on the balcony before heading out to dinner both nights.","[[0, 18], [369, 397]]","Would recommend this hotel.

I read some of the reviews before we left, and cannot understand what all of the complaining was for from some of the reviews that I read. We had an absolutely great time. The hotel was completely booked (President's Week), and we estimated that with 3,000 rooms, there were approximately 10,000 guests that week, but you would never know it. You did need to go down early to get a lounger by the superpool, but that was nothing to complain about. The staff was courteous, the rooms were terrific and the view was to die for! The hotel grounds are beautiful and there really is no reason to leave the hotel grounds. We did go on day journeys but also enjoyed the days sitting by the pool or on the beach (which just happens to be the best part of Waikiki Beach.)

You would have a wonderful vacation if you never left the Village. Everything you can possibly need or want is there. I even look forward to the almost daily trips to the ABC store!

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_7_a_summ_0,The hotel is tranquil and clean and overall an enjoyable place to stay whilst in Rome. The hotel is close to a number of local restaurants and the busier areas of Rome. The rooms in the hotel are adequate with spacious bathrooms. The staff leave a chocolate on the beds each night for their guests. The buffet breakfast was very good. The hotel's corridors were quite plain and could benefit from some decoration. The free Wi-Fi worked well and the Bulgari toiletries smelled lovely.,"Like the other reviewers, I have to say this hotel is close to perfect. The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-modern rooms on the two ""executive"" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, just off Piazza Navona in the historical center, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!","[[40, 70], [72, 119], [467, 514]]","Our second stay here in 12 months and the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return to Rome, just so I can stay here again! The location is second to none and we have been able to walk to all the main sights from here. We have stayed in three different rooms at this hotel and they have all been fabulous. The buffet breakfast is very good and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!","[[38, 101], [271, 276], [300, 322], [271, 276], [300, 322], [324, 357]]","We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated Richard Meier rooms, which was very nice, with a spacious bathroom and clever use of the available space. The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain, and the elevator needs a small facelift, but nonetheless it was fuctional and the guest doesn't spend any time there. Breakfast was quite good, especially for Italy, and the location just off piazza Navona, ideal. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc.","[[134, 153], [161, 200], [436, 460], [240, 316]]","Hotel Raphael is absolutely gorgeous!

Breakfast is amazing, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_7_a_summ_1,"The hotel is peaceful, spotless and comfortable enough. The hotel's location is unbeatable and great if you like the hustle and bustle. You will be able to walk to main places in the city including great historical locations as well as some nice restaurants. The rooms in this hotel are always really nice and have good bathrooms as well. The sheets are always clean and there are delicious chocolates provided on the bed each night. There was the option to have pre-dinner wine while watching the sunset, which was lovely. There was free WiFi as well as gorgeous toiletries provided, which made for lovely soaks in the bathtub. The decoration in the corridors needed a little bit of updating but otherwise facilities were great.","Like the other reviewers, I have to say this hotel is close to perfect. The rooms aren't as large as I would have liked (we were upgraded for an 8 night stay from a deluxe to one of the Richard Meier ultra-modern rooms on the two ""executive"" floors). I had been to Rome once before and, on the recommendation of friends, stayed in a fancy hotel on the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto area is sterile and not fun and we didn't really enjoy our stay there. But the Raphael, just off Piazza Navona in the historical center, is a whole other story. You walk out the door and you're right there, in the midst of everything. As befits a Relais & Chateaux hotel, everything is elegant and the staff and service are the best. Really, the only problem is paying the bill at the end!","[[26, 70], [467, 475], [493, 514], [206, 229], [651, 711]]","Our second stay here in 12 months and the service from this hotel is enough to make me want to return to Rome, just so I can stay here again! The location is second to none and we have been able to walk to all the main sights from here. We have stayed in three different rooms at this hotel and they have all been fabulous. The buffet breakfast is very good and the rooftop is a pleasant area to enjoy a drink or two after a long day of sight seeing. We were left 'tasty treats' on our room every day and we love the adjustable beds.The staff at the front desk are very helpful and friendly and the doorman was a delight! Hopefully we'll see you again next year!","[[255, 290], [300, 322], [142, 172], [190, 235], [255, 290], [300, 322]]","We stayed at the Raphael for 3 nights and we had an enjoyable stay there. Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated Richard Meier rooms, which was very nice, with a spacious bathroom and clever use of the available space. The hotel corridors could benefit from a decoration as they were a bit plain, and the elevator needs a small facelift, but nonetheless it was fuctional and the guest doesn't spend any time there. Breakfast was quite good, especially for Italy, and the location just off piazza Navona, ideal. The only downside is the staff, which while friendly and kind, didn't go beyond their duties for advice etc.","[[134, 153], [161, 200], [488, 530], [148, 153], [161, 200], [240, 316], [326, 357], [359, 362], [375, 391]]","Hotel Raphael is absolutely gorgeous! It is very comfortable, clean and quiet. A reasonable journey from Campiano Airport should cost you no more than 40 euro. Our sheets were changed every day and the delicious chocolates on our bed every night were fantastic. The Bulgari toiletries smell gorgeous so enjoyed several long soaks in the bath. Breakfast is amazing, made extra special by starting the day with a refreshing 'Bucks Fizz' Everything about the hotel is perfect the staff are very courteous and are most helpful. Would highly recommend and would most definately visit again. - Mike and Alison","[[41, 60], [38, 43], [72, 77], [38, 43], [62, 67], [160, 260], [262, 341], [343, 363]]","A beautiful hotel in a very bustling area of Rome. You expect everything to be perfect at an R&C but this is an entire staff taking service to whole new level. Arrangements for cars, tours and restaurants via email.way before you get there.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_7_a_summ_2,"The hotel is in the Via Veneto area and is comfortable and quiet with clean rooms. The location of this hotel in Rome is great. It is close enough to the attractions of Rome to walk to most and there are plenty of really nice places to eat nearby as well. Some of the rooms are on the small side but an upgrade to one of the newly renovated suites will sort this issue. they are spacious and modern and very nice. You can start your day with a very nice buffet breakfast in the morning or having wine before dinner while watching the sun setting on the hotel's rooftop. This hotel has access to many amenities, including free Wi-Fi. Although some of the decor could do with being updated, it's got everything that's needed for a good stay.","Like the other reviewers, I have to say this hotel is close to perfect.

CocoTrip,dev_cont,inst_7_b_summ_0,"The hospitality here at this hotel was so lovely and made the stay really good. There's nothing at all to complain about and cannot recommend this place enough. Everything is so close to this hotel that it's perfect based on location alone. Historical sites aren't too far by foot and places to eat and drink are only 50 metres away, with the river nearby too. The rooms are bursting with character and really lovely with period decoration and style. The bed was large so that is a bonus. Many of staff members were able to provide detailed information about the city and ideas for what to do and where. The hotel provided a breakfast to guests that was adequate, but with a superb coffee available. The top-deck roof garden is really spectacular and live up to the photos provided on the website.","Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner in August '09. The hotel is located 50m around the corner from the famous Campo De 'Fiori which is a wonderful area for eating and drinking as well as having great nightlife. The room itself was beautifully done in a period setting. Bed was large and aircon was fine. Staff extremely passionate and friendly about when and where to see the sights. Location is excellent as only a 5 minute walk to the piazza navona, 10 min walk to the trevi fountain and pantheon and 15 min walk to Vaticano and Colosseum. Also only a 10 min walk to the river and the wonderful trastevere area of eating/nightlife. There is a viewing deck above the top floor which is great to relax and have a few drinks and offers a really nice view of the area as well which was a bonus!

The breakfast was ample with excellent coffee.

The rooms in the hotel were perfectly adequate. They are in a European period style and furnished well. The bed was a good size and there was air con available in the room. Despite the sometimes noisy square nearby, nothing could be heard in the room. All staff members were approachable and kind despite being a wealth of knowledge.

Lovely rooms, designed beautifully in a period setting. The rooms are typically small in size, however they are loaded with charm and character that makes up for this, and the bathroom is fantastic. Although the location is noisy, you are unable to hear anything with the windows closed. The staff was knowledgeable about the city and the sights.

FewSum,val,property_15_summ_1,French restaurant that offers some dishes though not many French specials. Staff is friendly and includes a French-speaking server. Food quality is average and the environment is pleasant. Overall a good place to dine.,"Winterlicious 2016 - food was delicious:) One of Toronto's oldest restaurants I was told. Had the choice to upgrade to their classic french onion soup (which did not disappoint) for a starter, the mushroom medallions for my entree, and the pouding chomeur for dessert - didn't go wrong with these choices.","[[125, 150], [158, 176], [197, 230], [21, 39], [21, 39]]","I haven't been to Le Papillon in years and was and drawn to their patio on Front St. The brunch menu was mediocre, delicate (as in small serving size) dishes and wasn't cheap, $30 / head inc. tax and tip.
